<p>It was 1866, on the evening of a lovely spring day, and my
heroine was gathering flowers in one of the loveliest of the lovely
gardens of that sea-port city, Norfolk, Virginia.</p>

<p>A lovely garden indeed, with its spacious area, its graveled
walks and fountains, its graceful pavilions, its beautiful flowers,
and the tasteful villa that rose in the midst of this terrestrial
paradise looked very attractive outlined whitely against the dark
green of the lofty grove of trees stretching far into its rear.
Built on the suburbs of the city, in the portion of it known as
Ocean View, you could scarcely have imagined a fairer prospect
than that which met the eyes of the two gentlemen who idly
smoked and talked on the wide piazza fronting the sea.</p>

<p>The sun was setting in a blue May sky, sinking slowly and
sadly beneath the level of the sea, while far away, just faintly
outlined by its fading beams, glimmered the white sails and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
tapering spars of an outward-bound ship. How lonely it looked
on that vast ocean in the fading light,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Like the last beam that reddens over one&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">That sinks with those we love below the verge."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>To a poetic mind, the sight suggested many exquisite similitudes,
and Bruce Conway took the cigar from between his lips
and mused sadly as befitted the occasion, till the voice of his
companion jarred suddenly on his dreamy mood.</p>

<p>"Bruce, my boy, will you favor me with the earthly name of
the white-robed divinity whom I have observed for the last half-hour
flitting about this paradisiacal garden? Since my advent
here at noon to-day, I have not had the pleasure of meeting my
amiable hostess, yet I am persuaded that this youthful creature
cannot be your aunt."</p>

<p>"Smitten at sight&mdash;eh, Clendenon?" answered Mr. Conway,
with an attempt at archness. "That, my dear fellow, is my
aunt's companion, Miss Grey. She is coming this way, and I'll
introduce you."</p>

<p>He puffed away indolently at his fragrant cigar, while the
young girl of whom he had spoken came up the broad avenue
that led to the piazza steps, bearing on her arm a dainty basket
heaped high with flowers and trailing vines that overflowed the
edges of her basket and clung lovingly about her white robe.
She was, perhaps, seventeen years of age, and endowed with a
rare and peerless loveliness. A Mary of Scots, a Cleopatra
might have walked with that stately, uplifted grace, that rare,
unstudied poetry of motion. Slender, and tall, and lithe, with
her pale gold ringlets and marvelous fairness was combined so
much innocent sweetness that it brought the guest to his feet in
involuntary homage and admiration, while Mr. Conway himself
tossed away his cigar, and, hastening to meet her, took the
flowery burden from her arm, and assisted her up the steps.</p>

<p>"Miss Grey, allow me to present to you my friend, Captain
Clendenon," he said, in his graceful, off-hand way.</p>

<p>"Perfectly beautiful, faultily faultless!" murmured the captain
to himself, as he bowed over the delicate hand she shyly
offered.</p>

<p>With quiet grace she accepted the chair he placed for her,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
and, taking up a great lapful of flowers, answered a question
Mr. Conway asked:</p>

<p>"Yes, your aunt's headache is better, and she will be down
this evening. These flowers are for the drawing-room. You
know how she loves to see a profusion of flowers about the
house through the whole season."</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i22">"'Ah! one rose&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One rose, but one, by those fair fingers culled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were worth a hundred kisses pressed on lips<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Less exquisite than thine.'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It was like Bruce Conway's graceful impudence to quote those
lines, smiling up into the Hebe-like face of the girl. He was
the spoiled darling of fortune, the handsome idol of the fair sex,
as perfect in his dark, manly beauty as she in her opposite angelic
type. Yet she hesitated, trifling saucily with her flowers,
and half denying the rose he craved.</p>

<p>"I am chary of giving away roses obtained at the price of so
many thorns," said she, holding up a taper finger with a dark-red
scratch marking a zigzag course over its whiteness. "Gather
your roses yourself, sir."</p>

<p>"If I might gather those that blossom on your cheeks, I
might take the risk of the thorns," he answered, daringly.</p>

<p>The roses referred to deepened to vivid crimson, the golden
lights in the pansy-colored eyes sent a fiery gleam along the
black-fringed lashes, as she answered, indignantly:</p>

<p>"You forget yourself, and presume, sir."</p>

<p>"I did, indeed, but you know my idle habit of jesting.
Pardon me."</p>

<p>"Willingly, so that the offense is not repeated," she answered,
more gently, as she continued at her task, grouping the flowers
into tasteful bouquets, and ending by a fragrant gift to each
gentleman of a tiny posy for his button-hole, that restored sociability
and brought back the ease that had marked the first of
the interview.</p>

<p>"And to-morrow, Bruce," said the captain, presently, "I
shall see the last of you for years, if not forever. What possesses
you to go wandering off to Europe in this mad fashion?"</p>

<p>A smothered cry of astonishment caused him to look at Grace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
Grey. She was looking straight at Bruce Conway, the rose-bloom
dying away from her cheeks, and the beautiful eyes, eager,
questioning, startled, with a woman's love looking out of them,
and a woman's love revealed, alas! too plainly, in that mute
gaze.</p>

<p>Conway's dark eyes met hers for a moment with answering
love in their dark depths. Only a moment, though, and then
they wavered and fell, and he indifferently answered her mute
question:</p>

<p>"You look surprised, <i>ma petite</i>. Well, it is true that I leave
here to-morrow for an extended tour over Europe. I have long
thought of it, and the time has come at last."</p>

<p>No answer. She could not have spoken if life or death had
hung on a single sentence from those sweet lips, from whence
the rose-tint had faded, leaving them cold and white, and drawn
as if in pain. She gathered up her fragrant burdens and carried
them into the house, leaving a momentary shocked silence
behind her.</p>

<p>Presently the captain spoke, in the calm, assured tone in
which we chide a dear and intimate friend:</p>

<p>"Bruce, have you been flirting with that pretty, innocent
child?"</p>

<p>Conway fidgeted a little, but he answered nonchalantly
enough:</p>

<p>"Why do you ask? Have you fallen in love with her?"</p>

<p>"I was not speaking of myself; we will keep to the subject,
if you please. She <i>loves</i> you." His voice grew tender, reverential.</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>That simple monosyllable might have expressed many
things. In Bruce Conway's non-committal tone it meant
nothing.</p>

<p>"You will marry her?"</p>

<p>"Why, no."</p>

<p>The words came out with a jerk, as if they must be said, and
the sooner the better. The purple twilight hid his face and
expression, yet the captain persevered:</p>

<p>"Yet you love her?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>

<p>"Taking your assertion for granted," said Conway, coolly,
"is that any reason why I should marry Miss Grey?"</p>

<p>"It seems one to me."</p>

<p>"Very probably; but, <i>mon ami</i>, your view on this, as on
many other things, are old-fashioned and absurd, or, at least,
behind the times we live in. Do you happen to know, old fellow,
that I have completely run through my handsome fortune,
and that my 'great expectations' as my aunt's solo heir and
favorite are all I have to depend on?"</p>

<p>"I know it. What then?"</p>

<p>"'What then?'" boyishly mimicking the sober tone of the
older man. "If I must tell you, Clen, my aunt has positively
interdicted me from making love to her fair companion. I
might be courteously polite, soberly kind&mdash;nothing more, on
pain of disinheritance and eternal banishment from my relative's
imperious presence."</p>

<p>"You have disobeyed her."</p>

<p>"Not I. I have debarred myself from that exquisite pleasure,
and kept strictly to the letter of my aunt's command. I
have never told her I loved her, never addressed her a single
word of love, save in the ideal, poetical quotations to which she
can attach no real meaning. I am not to blame," talking a
little savagely; "and I suffer, too. I must go away. It is
madness for me to stay here longer, and cruel to her. My heart
aches for her&mdash;she is so fair, so pure, so trusting. I dare not
stay here another day, or I should break through Aunt Conway's
prohibition and tell her all that is in my heart. But once
away from the sight of her maddening beauty, I can forget her,
and returning home some time, take possession of my handsome
inheritance, and thank my lucky stars for the decision I
made to-day."</p>

<p>"Think a moment, dear friend. Is it not just as possible
that a day may come when you shall bitterly regret that
decision? When for the sake of the loving, trusting, friendless
child you desert to-day, you would peril not only your hopes
of present fortune and earthly prosperity, but your aspirations
for a brighter world?"</p>

<p>"Why pursue a useless subject? I have let you have your
say out, and heard you in patience. Now hear me. I do love<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
Grace Grey so passionately that, having had everything I
wanted heretofore in life, it is a hard struggle to be compelled
to resign her. But though I feel that I am acting almost a
villainous part, I cannot incur my aunt's penalty. Love of ease
and luxury is inherent in my nature, and I would not resign
the power of gratifying these propensities for the sake of any
woman's love. Even if I risked all to do the love-in-cottage
romance, what have I left to offer Miss Grey along with my
name and love?"</p>

<p>"Your broad breast to shield her; your clear brain and
strong arms to toil for her."</p>

<p>"Mere visionary fancies! I am too indolent to work with
head or hands. My vocation is that of an idler. I shall go to
Europe, see all that is to be seen, shiver foggy London, plunge
head and soul into the gay and giddy circles of dear delightful
Paris, return, inherit Aunt Conway's fortune, marry some heiress
of her choosing, and live happy ever after."</p>

<p>"I doubt it. Good-night."</p>

<p>"Come back&mdash;you are not going? I shall drive you into
town after tea&mdash;my aunt expects to see you&mdash;Clendenon,
I say!"</p>

<p>He hurried down the walk after the tall, proud form stalking
coldly away, and stopped him with a hand upon his shoulder.</p>

<p>"Clen, are you angry with me? Don't think of it! You
know there are some subjects on which we never agree. I am
sorry I did not hear your expostulations with more patience.
That is saying more than I would say to any other man living,
but I don't forgot that it is for me you wear that empty sleeve
across your breast&mdash;that you gave freely to save my worthless
life the strong arm that was worth more than a dozen such men
as I. And are we to separate at last for a woman's sake?"</p>

<p>It was true. They had shared the same camp-fire, slept
under the same scanty blanket, battled side by side in the far-famed
gray uniform, and when death threatened the one the
strong arm of the other had been raised to shield him. Had it
been necessary he would have given his life as freely as he gave
his strong left arm.</p>

<p>He could not forget in a moment the friendship of years, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
he yielded half-reluctantly to the detaining hand that drew him
back to the house.</p>

<p>"I confess that I go back with you unwillingly," he said, in
his grave, frank way. "You have shown me a new phase of
your character, Bruce, and I do not in the least admire it.
I trust yet to hear you repudiate your decision as unworthy of
yourself as well as unjust to the girl whose sacred love you have
trifled with."</p>

<p>"Perhaps I may yet," was the hurried reply. "I am so
divided between conflicting emotions that I scarcely know my
own mind yet. I may yet decide as you wish me to do."</p>

<p>Part of this was said to conciliate his friend, and part of it
was true, for Bruce Conway did not err when he said that he
scarcely know his own mind. The most of his failings and follies,
as of a great many other people, arose from this amiable
trait in his character.</p>

<p>He had not decided when the pleasant social ceremony of the
nine o'clock tea was over, and leaving Captain Clendenon deep
in converse with his stately hostess, he beguiled the younger
lady into a walk down to the sea-shore. There standing, arm
in arm, on the pebbly beach, he almost made up his mind.
For she was <i>so</i> beautiful, and he loved beauty. A love of
beauty was inherent in his luxurious nature, and Grace Grey
was the fairest creature he had ever beheld as she lifted her shy
glance to his in the brilliant moonlight, while as yet neither had
spoken a word.</p>

<p>Why need they have spoken? It needed but that his hand
should seek and hold hers in that lingering clasp that tells the
all and all of love. But the soft breeze went sighing past like
a spirit, the eternal sea surged strangely on, the stars burned,
and the moon went under a transient cloud, while far away in
the southern heavens a great red <i>meteor</i> flamed out and shone
brilliantly among the silver stars. Both saw it at once, and
both uttered an affected cry of surprise&mdash;affected, I say, because
I do not think anything would have surprised them then, they
were so absorbed in each other, so happy and yet so unhappy,
as they stood together there, their young hearts throbbing "so
near and yet so far."</p>

<p>She did not dream as she watched that fiery orb of light that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
her future hung on its transient beaming. She knew, with a
woman's keen intuition, that he had brought her there to learn
her fate. What it was to be she could not guess. Certainly she
did not think that the man beside her had staked their two
futures on the hazard of a meteor, and that when it paled and
faded from the stormy sky he whispered to himself: "As was
my love for her! Burning and comet-like as was that meteor, it
shall fade as soon and leave me free."</p>

<p>Was it? Did the future prove so? Tenderly&mdash;more tenderly
than he had ever done&mdash;he lifted the thin white drapery, half
falling from her shoulders, and folded it closely about her.</p>

<p>"How heavily the dew falls," he said, kindly. "We had better
return to the house."</p>

<p>Mrs. Conway looked curiously up as the pair came slowly
into the drawing-room, and was content with what her keen
glance read in the faces that wore the light mask of indifferent
smiles.</p>

<p>"Gracie, child," in her most affable way, "don't let our guest
leave us without the rare treat of hearing you sing. Captain
Clendenon, will you turn the music for her?"</p>

<p>"The attraction of Grace's music, its greatest charm, lies in
its wonderful pathos and expressiveness," condescended the
haughty hostess, as the guest's firm lip softened while listening
to the spirit-like melodies that sobbed and wailed along the
piano keys, answering to the touch of the skillful fingers and
the sweet voice.</p>

<p>At length she selected an old song, and with a single glance
at Conway, sang the first stanza through:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Sweetheart, good-by! the fluttering sail<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Is set to bear me far from thee;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And soon before the favoring gale<br /></span>
<span class="i3">My ship shall bound upon the sea.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Perchance, all desolate and forlorn,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">These eyes shall miss thee many a year;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">But unforgotten every charm,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Though lost to sight to mem'ry dear!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The wounded young heart could sustain itself no longer. She
rose and passed hastily from the room. It was her farewell to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
her unworthy lover. When he left home in the early dawn,
amid the tearful lamentations of his adoring aunt, Miss Grey
had not arisen from her feverish slumbers.</p>

<p>Mrs. Conway was not wearing the willow for her wandering
nephew. On the contrary, her elegant rooms constantly witnessed
merry gatherings, where mirth and music reigned supreme.
She was still a handsome woman, still a brilliant
woman, and the world of society, fashion, and folly held her as
one of its leaders. The delicate state of her health had improved,
she had dispensed with her fair companion, and on a
sweet spring night, just four years from the date of the beginning
of this story, she was giving a splendid ball in honor of
the wife of the distinguished and handsome Senator Winans, of
Virginia.</p>

<p>The elite of Norfolk was gathered there, the house was garnished
with wreaths and garlands of flowers, till the long drawing-rooms
opening into each other looked like fast succeeding
vistas of intoxicating bloom. Music rose voluptuously overall,
and the proud hostess moved among her guests looking handsome
as a picture, and young for her fifty-four years, in the sea-green
silk and misty laces that accorded so well with her dark
eyes and hair, and sweetly smiling mouth.</p>

<p>But under all her brightness and gayety Mrs. Conway carried
an uneasy pang in her proud heart. It was the neglect of her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
idolized nephew. She had never had any children of her own,
and at the death of her husband the orphan boy of her only
brother crept into her heart, and held the only place in it that
was worth having; for the heart of a fashionable fine lady, I
take it, has little room to spare from the vanities of dress and
fashion; but whatever vacant room there remained in Mrs. Conway's,
it all belonged to her self-exiled nephew, and for many
months no news had come of the traveler. He had roved from one
end of Europe to the other, and wearied of it all, but still talked
not of coming home, and his aunt missed him sadly. He had
been unfeignedly fond of her. He was her nearest living relative,
her chosen heir, and she wanted him home for the few remaining
years of her life. But with the underlying strength of
her proud heart she kept those feelings to herself, and none
were the wiser for them.</p>

<p>And in the midst of the music and dancing a stranger crept to
the door of the anteroom, and looked anxiously in&mdash;Bruce Conway.
A little thinner, a little bronzed by travel, a little more
grave looking, but every bit as handsome as the dashing young
follow who had gambled with a meteor for his chance of happiness
and&mdash;lost.</p>

<p>Was he looking for his aunt? Twice she passed near enough
to have touched him with her hand, but he smiled and let her
pass on, not dreaming of his near presence.</p>

<p>At last his eyes encountered what they sought, and, half unconsciously,
he drew nearer, and scanned the peerless vision
framed in the door-way of the conservatory, in the soft but
brilliant light of the wax-lights half-hidden in flowers.</p>

<p>Was she a creature of this lower earth? He had thought, that
spring four years ago, with Grace Grey at seventeen, leaning on
his arm, looking into his face in the moonlight, that she was more
a creature of heaven than earth. He thought so again to-night,
as he looked at her leaning there under the arch of flowers that
framed the conservatory door. He thought of all the living
loveliness, the sculptured perfection, the radiant beauty that
seemed to breathe on the canvas&mdash;all he had seen in his wanderings
from shore to shore&mdash;and nothing he could recall was half
so glorious as Grace Grey at twenty-one, in her calm repose,
standing quietly looking on at the scene, seeming herself, to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
fascinated eyes that beheld her, like a young angel strayed away
from paradise.</p>

<p>Mr. Conway slipped around and entered the room by a side
door in the rear of where she stood. At sound of his footstep
she turned slowly and looked at him carelessly, then looking
again, threw up one hand. Was she going to faint? Not she!
Her face whitened, her pansy-violet eyes grew black with intense
emotion, but without a tremor she offered the little cold hand he
had dashed away from him so long before. It was as cold now
as it had been then&mdash;had it never been warm since, he wondered.</p>

<p>"Welcome home!" he heard in the remembered music of her
voice.</p>

<p>"Oh, Grace, my darling, my wronged little love!" He knew
his own mind at last, and was down on his knees before she could
prevent him, passionately entreating, "My darling, will you
forgive me, and give yourself to me? I have come home to
make reparation for the past. I never knew how dear you were,
how entirely I loved you, till the ocean rolled between us."</p>

<p>For a moment the silence of unspeakable emotion fell between
them; she struggled for speech, waving her hand for him to
pause, while over her pure, pale face a flood of indignant crimson
warmly drifted.</p>

<p>"Rise, sir," she answered, at last, in low, proud tones, "such
words are an insult to me!"</p>

<p>"And why? Oh! Grace, can you not forgive me, can you
not love me? You loved me once, I know. Don't send me
away. Promise that I may still love you, that you will be my
worshiped wife!"</p>

<p>She did not laugh at him, as you or I might have done, my
reader. It was not in the nature of the girl Bruce Conway had
scorned for her low estate to be anything but sweet and merciful.
She looked at him, still faintly flushed and excited, but
answered with unconsciously straightening figure, and a firm
but gentle dignity peculiar to her always:</p>

<p>"Possibly you are not aware, Mr. Conway, that your words
of love are addressed to one who is already a wife&mdash;and
mother."</p>

<p>Mr. Conway had never fainted in his life, but with a feeling
that sense and strength were giving way, he rose, and, dropping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
into a chair, white as death, looked at the young creature whose
quiet assertion of matronly dignity had fallen on his ears like a
death-warrant. And as he looked, with that strange power we
have of discriminating details even in the most eventful hours,
he noticed many things that went far to prove the truth of her
words. He had left her poor and almost friendless, her richest
dress a simple white muslin, and scarcely another piece of jewelry
than the simple trinket of gold and pearls that clasped the
frill of lace at her white throat. To-night she wore a sweeping
robe of costly white silk, with flouncings of real lace, that was
worth a small fortune in itself. There were diamonds on the
wavering swell of her white bosom, depending from the pearly
ears, scintillating fire from her restless taper wrists, clasping her
statuesque throat like sunshine glowing on snow. She was
wealthy, prosperous, beloved now, he read in the restful peace
that crowned her innocent brow; and bitterest thought of all to
the man who had loved and deserted her&mdash;another man called
her <i>his wife</i>&mdash;another man's child called her mother.</p>

<p>While she stood with that flush of offended wifely dignity
burning hotly on her pure cheek, while he looked at her with a
soul's despair written on his handsome features, a gentleman
entered the room carrying an ice. He was tall and splendidly
handsome, his countenance frank, and pleasant, but a slight
frown contracted his brow as he took in the scene, and it did
not clear away as the lady said, distantly:</p>

<p>"Mr. Conway, allow me the pleasure of presenting to you my
husband, Senator Winans."</p>

<p>Both gentlemen bowed ceremoniously, but neither offered the
hand. Mr. Conway hated Winans already, and the gentleman
thus honored felt intuitively that he should hate Conway. So
their greeting was of the briefest. The discomfited traveler
turned and walked over to the Hon. Mrs. Winans.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon," he said, in low, earnest tones; "I did
not know&mdash;had not heard the least hint of your marriage."</p>

<p>He was gone the next moment. Senator Winans looked
inquiringly at his beautiful young wife. She did not speak;
he fancied she shrank a little as he looked at her, but as he set
down the ice on a small flower-stand near by, she took up the
little golden spoon and let a tiny bit of the frozen cream melt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
on her ruby lip, while a faint smile dimpled the corners of her
mouth.</p>

<p>"My love," he said, lifting the small, white hand, and toying
with its jeweled fingers, "are you ill? Your hand is cold
as ice."</p>

<p>"I never felt better in my life," smiling up into his questioning
eyes, and nestling the small hand still closer in his. "The
cold cream chilled me after dancing so much, or," her natural
truthfulness asserting itself, "I may be a little nervous, and
that makes my hands cold."</p>

<p>"And what has made you nervous to-night?" his tone
unconsciously stern and his thoughts full of the dark, despairing
face that had looked up from the depths of the arm-chair at
his queenly looking wife.</p>

<p>"Nothing," she answered, dreamily, while a swift flush burned
on her cheek, and she turned away a little petulantly and began
to trifle with the ice again.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, but it was something, and that something
was the man who has just left us. Who and what is he?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Bruce Conway, nephew and heir of our hostess. He
has been abroad four years, I think, and but just returned."</p>

<p>"An old acquaintance of yours, then?"</p>

<p>"Well, yes."</p>

<p>She turned toward him with marvelous sweetness and self-command.</p>

<p>"During my stay with Mrs. Conway I was naturally brought
frequently in contact with her nephew. I found him a pleasant
acquaintance."</p>

<p>"Nothing more&mdash;was he not a lover?"</p>

<p>His beautiful dark eyes seemed to burn into her soul, so full
were they of jealous pain and sudden doubt.</p>

<p>She came up to him, crossing her round white arms over one
of his, looking up at him with an arch, merry smile.</p>

<p>"I really cannot say, since he never confessed to a tender passion
for me. The difference in our stations precluded anything of
the sort. You must remember that there are few men like you,
my loyal love, who stooped to lift a beggar-maid to share your
throne."</p>

<p>Her eyes were misty and full of unshed tears, partly out of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
gratitude and love for him, and partly&mdash;she could not help it&mdash;because
she was conscious of a sharp, agonized remembrance
of a night four years before, the very thought of which made
her turn white and cold as death as she leaned upon her husband's
arm.</p>

<p>One hand beneath her dimpled chin lifted her face to meet his
gaze. She met it sweetly and frankly, but he knew her well
enough to know that the intense blackness of her dilated eyes
denoted deep emotion.</p>

<p>"Tell me the truth, Gracie," he entreated. "That man looked
at you as no mere acquaintance ever looked at a woman&mdash;looked
at you as he had no right to look at the wife of another
man! What mystery is this you are trying to withhold from
me? If you refuse to answer what I have a right to know you
force me to seek satisfaction from him."</p>

<p>He was terribly in earnest. The baleful fire of doubt and
jealousy burned in his eagle gaze, and startled the young
creature who read its language with a vague doubt creeping into
her soul. She did not want to deceive her husband&mdash;still less
did she want to tell him the truth for which he asked.</p>

<p>"Spare me!" she entreated. "There is nothing to tell, my
love&mdash;nothing of any consequence, I mean. It would but annoy
you to hear it, mortify me to tell it," and once more the warm
blush of insulted matronly pride tinged the girlish cheek with
crimson.</p>

<p>"For all that I insist upon having an explanation of the
scene I witnessed here after leaving you scarcely a minute before!"</p>

<p>Unconsciously to himself he shook off the small hands that
clasped his arm in his eager interest and excitement. She did
not replace them, but, folding both her arms across her breast,
lifted her pale, earnest face to his.</p>

<p>Her answer came low and sweet, though perhaps a trifle impatient,
as though the subject seemed to her scarcely worth this
"wordy war."</p>

<p>"Well, then, Mr. Bruce Conway startled me very much by
entering here quite suddenly and making me an offer of his
hand, declaring that he had learned to love me while abroad. I
checked him by telling him that I was a wife and mother. You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
heard his apology to me&mdash;he did not know of my marriage.
That is all there is to tell."</p>

<p>He looked at her and half smiled at thought of Conway's discomfiture;
but the passing merriment was displaced in a moment
by the sharp pain tugging at his heart-strings. He had
the jealous Southern nature to perfection. He could not endure
even the thought that another had ever enshrined in his heart
the image of Grace, his lovely girl-bride. So sharp a pang tore
his heart that he could not move nor speak.</p>

<p>"Paul, my husband"&mdash;she looked up at him as wondrously
fair in his eyes as she had been in Bruce Conway's, and with a
timid grace that was infinitely becoming to her&mdash;"surely you
do not blame me. I could not help it. I am sorry it has happened.
I cannot say more."</p>

<p>It was not in human nature to withstand the mute pleading
of her manner, or the soft gaze that met his own. He stooped
and touched his lips to her pure brow.</p>

<p>"Let us go, love," he said. "I confess that I shall feel better
away from here and in our pleasant home."</p>

<p>"But this reception was given for us. Our hostess will feel
offended at so early a departure."</p>

<p>"I will tell her we were called away&mdash;that is, unless you wish
to remain."</p>

<p>"No, indeed; I would rather be at home with my precious
baby; and your wishes are always mine, Paul."</p>

<p>How exquisitely she tempered wifely submission and obedience
with gentleness and love! If there was a cross in her life, she
wreathed it over with flowers. Her soothing voice fell like the
oil of peace on the troubled waters of his soul.</p>

<p>Long after their adieus to their hostess had been spoken, and
his arm had lovingly lifted her into her carriage, Bruce Conway's
eyes watched vacantly the spot where she had vanished
from his sight, while that haggard wanness of despair never left
his face. Never until the hour in which he knew her irrevocably
lost to him did he realize how deeply rooted in his soul his love
had been. Amid all the glories of the old world he had felt
that life was a desert without her, and in the Arabian deserts
the knowledge had dawned slowly upon him, that even here
her mere presence would have created a paradise of bliss.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
Far away from her, unconsciously to her, he had mentally
renounced his anticipated inheritance, and come home with the
fixed intention of winning her, and toiling, if need be, cheerfully
for her.</p>

<p>Not a thought of disappointment, not a possibility of her
marriage had crossed his mind. It was left to this hour, when
he stood there listening to the slow crunch of her carriage
wheels that seemed grinding over his heart as they rolled away,
to know his own heart truly, and to feel how much better than
he knew himself his friend had known him when he said, on
almost the same spot where he now stood alone:</p>

<p>"Is it not just as possible that the day may come when for
the sake of the loving, trusting, friendless child you desert
to-day, you would peril not only your hopes of present fortune
and future prosperity, but your aspirations for a brighter
world?"</p>

<p>It had come. Passionate heart, undisciplined temper, unsatisfied
yearnings clamored fiercely for the woman who had
loved him as he would never be loved again. He would have
given then, in his wild abandonment to his love and despair, all
his hopes of fortune, his dreams of fame, his chances of futurity,
to have stood for one hour in the place of the man who, even
then in his beautiful home, clasped wife and child in one embrace
to his noble heart, while he thanked God for the treasure
of a pure woman's love.</p>

<p>A touch on his shoulder, a voice in his ear jarred suddenly
on his wild, semi-savage mood.</p>

<p>"Be a man, Bruce, old fellow, be a man. It is too late for
unavailing regrets. Call all your manhood to your aid."</p>

<p>"Clendenon, is it you?" He turned and wrung his friend's
hand with a grip that must have pained him. "Have you come
to exult over my misery with the stereotyped 'I told you so?'"</p>

<p>"Can you think it of me? Bruce, I have watched you for
the last five minutes, and I understand your feelings. From
my soul I pity you!"</p>

<p>"Don't! Sympathy I cannot bear&mdash;even from you, old boy.
Clen, how long has it been&mdash;when was she,"&mdash;a great gulp&mdash;"married?"</p>

<p>"More than eighteen months ago Senator Winans saw her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
first at one of your aunt's receptions, where she was brought
forward to perform a difficult sonata for a musical party. He
saw and loved (what man could see her and not love her?)
There was a brief courtship, a brilliant marriage, under the rejoicing
auspices of your aunt, and the beautiful Hon. Mrs.
Winans was the belle of last season in Washington, as her husband
was one of the most notable members of the Senate. She
has been 'the fashion' ever since."</p>

<p>"So she was like all other women, after all," sneered Conway,
in jealous rage. "Sold herself. So much beauty, intellect,
and frivolity&mdash;for a brilliant establishment, a proud name,
and high position."</p>

<p>"I think not. They live very happily, I am told. He is
worthy any woman's love, and has won hers, no doubt. And,
Bruce, I don't think anything could make her worldly or calculating.
As much of the angel is about her as is possible for
mortal to possess."</p>

<p>Conway looked suddenly up into the handsome, inscrutable
face of the speaker.</p>

<p>"Clen, <i>mon ami</i>, if it had to be any one else than me, I wish
it had been you that had married her. You are deserving of
any blessing that can come into a good man's life."</p>

<p>"Thanks," his friend answered, simply, and moved aside to
make way for Mrs. Conway, who swept out on the piazza and
up to the side of her nephew. Somehow the news of his return
had been noised about the rooms, and she had come to
seek him, vexed and mortified that he had not come to her, but
still very happy to know that he was there at all.</p>

<p>"My dear boy," she said, as she clasped his hand and took
the gallant kiss he offered, "this is, indeed, a joyful surprise.
Will you come up into my boudoir, where we can have a quiet
chat to ourselves, before your many friends claim your attention?"</p>

<p>Silent and moody he followed her. Once within the quiet
seclusion of her own special apartment, and she turned upon
him with a sudden storm of reproaches.</p>

<p>"Bruce, what is all this I hear? That gossiping old maid, Miss
Lavinia Story, has spread from one guest to the other a sensational
report of your meeting Mrs. Winans in the conservatory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
just now, and proposing to her under the impression that she
was still Miss Grey, my late companion. It can't be true of
you; don't say it is, and make me ashamed of you in the very
hour of your return. You could not have been guilty of such
rashness and stupidity. Give me authority to deny it to our
friends."</p>

<p>"I can't do it." He was always rather laconic in his way of
speaking, and he answered her now in a moody, don't-care,
scarcely respectful sort of style, without even looking at her.
"It's all true, every word of it, and more besides."</p>

<p>"Bruce, Bruce, what madness!"</p>

<p>"Was it? Well, I suppose you did not expect as much manliness
as that even from one who had been so ready to sell himself
for your gold. But I could not do it, Aunt Conway. You
know well enough that I loved her. That was why you were so
willing I should go away. But I did not forget her so easily as
I thought I would. My love only strengthened with time until
I resolved to resign my claims to your fortune, come home, win
her, and work for her like a man. I came, saw her, forgot all
about the proprieties, and spoke at once. I didn't stop to think
why she wore silk instead of muslin, diamonds instead of
flowers. I saw only her heavenly, sweet face, and blundered
straight into&mdash;making a laughing-stock of myself for all your
acquaintance!"</p>

<p>"Exactly!" groaned Mrs. Conway. "Miss Story eavesdropped&mdash;she
pretends to have heard it purely accidentally. The old&mdash;"</p>

<p>"News-carrier!" grimly suggested her nephew, finding her at
a loss for a word.</p>

<p>"You may well say that! She will have it all over Norfolk
to-morrow. Oh! how it mortifies my pride to have anything
occur to disgrace me so! Bruce, I could almost find it in my
heart to curse you!"</p>

<p>"And I you! You are to blame for it all. But for you and
your foolish pride of wealth and position, I might have wooed
and won her; but while I wavered in my shameful vacillation
and selfishness, a better and nobler man has stepped in between
us! You are proud to welcome <i>him</i>, proud to do him honor;
proud to welcome her in her beauty and grace, now that you
have put her forever out of my reach. But you are well repaid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
to-night. Look at my blasted hopes and ruined life, and curse
yourself, your gold, everything that has come between two loving
hearts and sundered them forever!"</p>

<p>He threw the words at her like a curse, stepped outside the
door, and slammed it heavily after him.</p>

<p>She saw him no more that night.</p>

<p>"You may go, Norah," said Grace Winans, looking up from
the child on her breast at the sleepy-eyed nurse. "If I need
you again I can ring the bell;" and, smiling, Norah bowed and
withdrew.</p>

<p>It was almost twelve o'clock, and Grace had exchanged her
ball-dress for a white <i>neglige</i>, and sat in the nursery, holding
her babe in her arms, and smiling thoughtfully down at the
tiny, winsome face. Mother and child made a wondrously fair
picture in the soft shade of the wax-lights, that burned with
subdued brightness in the dainty, airy, white-hung room. The
girlish mother leaned a little forward as she sat in the low
rocking-chair, her bright curls falling over the loosely flowing
white dress like a golden glory. Her pure, innocent eyes looked
down at the babe that nestled in her arms, and a low murmur
of tenderness escaped her lips.</p>

<p>"My Birdie! my baby!"</p>

<p>"Still sitting up, Grace?"</p>

<p>It was the voice of her husband entering to pay his nightly
visit to the little bright-eyed babe&mdash;sole heir of his proud name
and wealth.</p>

<p>"I am not tired," she answered, in her fresh young voice,
"and our little darling is so sweet I cannot bear to lay him
down. Only look at him, Paul!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>


<p>Paul Winans bent down and clasped mother and child in one
fond embrace.</p>

<p>"My two babes!" he whispered.</p>

<p>A sunny smile broke over the young wife's face. The pet
name pleased her, for she was still scarcely more than a child
in her quick appreciation of affection, and, like a child, she
could scarcely have understood an affection that did not express
itself in tender epithets and warm caresses. She nestled her
bright head against his arm, sighing softly in the fullness of her
content.</p>

<p>Tender and trustful as a little child, always ready to sacrifice
her own wishes to those of others, only asking to love and be
loved, our pretty Grace made a charming wife and mother.
Prosperity had not spoiled her warm heart nor her clear judgment,
and the greatest aim of her loving life was to please her
noble husband in all things&mdash;her highest ambition to be to him
always, as she was then, the guiding star of his life.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Some flowers of Eden we still inherit,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">But the trail of the serpent is over them all."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Over this exquisite picture of domestic peace and love broke
the storm-cloud and the tempest. It was but a moment after
Paul Winans kissed his happy wife before the stillness of the
midnight hour was broken by a sound that rose from the street
below, and was directly beneath the window.</p>

<p>First, a mournful guitar prelude; then a man's voice singing
in the very accents of despair, and he finished the song of which
Grace had sung the first stanza for him four years before:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Sweetheart, good-by! One last embrace!<br /></span>
<span class="i3">O cruel fate! two souls to sever!<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Yet in this heart's most sacred place<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Thou, thou alone, shalt dwell forever!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"And still shall recollection trace<br /></span>
<span class="i3">In fancy's mirror, ever near,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Each smile, each tear, that form, that face&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Though lost to sight, to mem'ry dear!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Husband and wife listened in unbroken silence to the strain.
The senator's arm tightened about his wife and child, and she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
sat mute and still, every line of her face as moveless as if
carved from marble. But as the lingering notes died away, her
hand sought and touched the tiny blue-and-silver tassel that
depended from the bell-cord, and sent its low tinkle through
the house.</p>

<p>Norah, who always answered the nursery-bell, came in after
the lapse of a moment. To her Mrs. Winans said, in a voice that
sounded stern and cold for her silver-sweet tones:</p>

<p>"Norah, go to the front door and tell that madman that he
had better move on&mdash;that the family do not wish to be disturbed
by such nonsense at this hour of the night."</p>

<p>The woman withdrew obediently.</p>

<p>Paul Winans turned, and walked restlessly up and down the
room.</p>

<p>"So he dares come and serenade my wife directly under my
window!"</p>

<p>His dark eyes blazed, his cheeks flamed, and his hand involuntarily
clenched itself.</p>

<p>Grace looked up at him, still immovably calm and silent;
but a slight nervous movement of her arm showed that she
heard and understood. She looked up questioningly as Norah
appeared in the door-way.</p>

<p>"He was gone, ma'am, before I got down to the door."</p>

<p>"Very well; you may go, then."</p>

<p>And, as before, Norah went out, with her small courtesy,
and left the pair alone.</p>

<p>"Grace!"</p>

<p>"Well, dear?"</p>

<p>Her voice had the same sweet cadence as usual, and her
smile was as gentle as ever when she looked up at the princely
form before her. His voice, his look, showed his insulted
pride and outraged heart. Her only trace of emotion showed
in marble pallor and darkening eyes.</p>

<p>"I do not understand this!" his voice slow and intense.
"I thought I had found a pearl so pure and isolated that no
other man's eyes had ever looked on it to covet its beauty for
himself. That was my highest glory. Fame, fortune, pleasure
were nothing to me in comparison with my pride in my wife,
and that pride was the greater because a passionately jealous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
nature like mine is only satisfied in holding the first place in the
beloved heart. And this I thought I held in yours. To-night I
learn for the first time that long before I ever met you another
man looked on you to love you; perhaps you loved him."</p>

<p>His voice died away in a throb of passionate pain. He leaned
against the rosewood, lace-draped crib, and looked down at her
with their child in her arms, hoping she would deny it. She
did not. Dead silence fell between them, and her soft eyes
never wavered in their frank, upward look at him. They met
his calmly, expectantly, their starry, inscrutable depths telling
no secrets.</p>

<p>"Grace!"</p>

<p>"What is it, Paul?"</p>

<p>"Say something&mdash;you are so cold&mdash;anything to allay the fire
that burns in my veins. I think I am mad to-night."</p>

<p>"My dearest, what can I say more than I have already told
you? Mr. Conway proposed to me under a most mortifying
mistake. I am not answerable for a man's infatuation with a
fair face. I do not know what has induced him to make such a
demonstration here to-night. Possibly he is under the influence
of wine, and hardly knows the folly he is perpetrating;
possibly we may never see or hear of him after this. Let us
dismiss him from our thoughts."</p>

<p>Spoken so sweetly, so calmly, so indifferently. Her seeming
calmness subdued and quelled momentarily his stormy feelings,
as a strong, well-balanced mind always curbs a fitful, unquiet
one.</p>

<p>"Then you do not care for him, Grace?"</p>

<p>She was threading her slim fingers meditatively through the
dark curls that clustered on the brow of her child. She glanced
up, her snow-white cheek flushing a fitful scarlet, her voice and
look full of proud reproach.</p>

<p>"Paul, you are speaking to the mother of your child."</p>

<p>That quiet dignity recalled him to a sense of what was due
to his wife. His brow cleared, his voice softened, as he answered:</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, Gracie, dearest. I ought to have known
your pure heart better than to insult it by a doubt. Your heart,
I know, is mine now, or you would never have been my wife.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
I know your pure honor and truth too well to think otherwise.
But oh, my love, my sweet wife, if I knew&mdash;if I knew that your
warm, true heart had ever throbbed with one sigh of love for
another, I should, even though it had happened before I ever
saw you, never again know one happy moment. You may think
it is jealous madness&mdash;it may be&mdash;but it is inherent in my nature,
and I cannot help it. I repeat that I could never, never be
happy again."</p>

<p>No answer. Grace Winans' white arms wreathed themselves
around her baby, pressing it closer, as if to still the sharp pang
that struck home to her very heart. A faint shiver thrilled her,
and rising, she laid the little sleeper in its downy nest, smiling
a little sadly as she looked, but smiling still, for this tiny rosebud
was the sweetest and most wonderful thing that had ever
come into her lonely life. Deeply as she had loved the first object
of her young affections, purely and truly as she loved her
gifted husband, the strongest, deepest, most intense passion of
her life was her maternal love. Some one has written half jestingly
that "the depths of a woman's love can never be sounded
till a baby is dropped into her heart," but it is true of the majority
of women. It was especially true of Grace Winans. That
little, rosy, lace-robed slumberer, small as it was, enshrining a
human soul, was the idol of the young mother's life. Perhaps
she was excusable. It was the only thing that had ever loved
her purely and unselfishly. She could scarcely recollect her
parents, she could not recall any one who had ever lavished on
her such love as this child gave her, so devoted, so unreasoning,
so absorbing; and deeply, unselfishly as she loved her husband,
she loved his child better, though no word nor sign ever betrayed
the fact to his jealous eyes. She reached up to him now,
and drew him to her side, holding his arm about her waist with
both dimpled white hands.</p>

<p>"My darling," she whispered, "don't be so unreasonable.
You have no <i>cause</i> to be jealous, none at all. My whole heart is
yours&mdash;yours and the baby's. You must have faith in me, Paul&mdash;have
faith in me, and trust me as you do your own heart."</p>

<p>Drawing his moody face down to hers she kissed him with
child-like simplicity. At the persuasive touch of those tender
lips his brow cleared, his listless clasp tightened around her,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
and both arms held her strained closely to his breast, his lips
raining kisses on her brow, her cheeks, her lips, even her fair
golden hair.</p>

<p>"Now you are like yourself," the musical voice whispered
gladly. "You will not be jealous and unhappy again. I am
yours alone, dear one&mdash;heart, and soul, and body&mdash;your own
loving, happy little wife."</p>

<p>The sunshine on her face was tenderly reflected on his. She
was so sweet and winsome, so womanly, yet withal so child-like
and oh, <i>so</i> beautiful! His strange, unusual mood was not
proof against the witchery of her loveliness, her flowing hair,
the subtle perfume breathing from her garments, the tenderness
of her words and looks.</p>

<p>"I don't think another man in the world has such a precious
wife!" he said.</p>

<p>And though she knew that every man's private opinion regarding
his own wife was the same, she took heart at his words
of praise, and laughed archly. They two were that novel sight
"under the sun," a pair of married lovers. Why need he have
gone back to the forbidden subject? Ah! why have we always
"done that which we ought not to have done?" Because he
wanted to make himself miserable, I suppose. There is no
other reason I can assign for his persistence; and, as for that,
there is no reason whatever in a jealous man. "He is simply
jealous for he is jealous," and where Shakespeare could not find
a reason for a thing, how can I?</p>

<p>"Gracie, may I ask you one question?"</p>

<p>"You may&mdash;certainly."</p>

<p>"And will you answer it truthfully?</p>

<p>"If I answer it at all," she gravely made answer, "it must
needs be truthfully, for I could not reply to you otherwise.
But why ask a question at all? I do not care to question you
of your past; why should you question me of mine? Let past
and future alone, Paul. The present only is ours&mdash;let us enjoy
it."</p>

<p>And heedless of the warning shadow that fell across her pathetic
face, he persevered:</p>

<p>"Only tell me this, my precious wife. This Bruce Conway,
who went away to Europe to learn that he loved you, and came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
back to tell you so. Gracie, in that past time when you knew
him&mdash;before you ever knew me&mdash;did you&mdash;tell me truly, mind&mdash;did
you ever love him?"</p>

<p>The question she had dreaded and shrunk from all the time!
She knew it would come, and now that it had, what could she
say?</p>

<p>How easy it would have been to confess the truth to a less
passionate and jealous mind. It was no sin, not even a fault in
her, and she was not afraid to tell him save with the moral cowardice
that makes one dread the necessary utterance of words
that must inflict pain. What harm was there in that dreamy
passion that had cast its glamour over a few months of her girlhood?
It was unkind in him to probe her heart so deeply.
She dared not own the truth to him if its telling were to make
him unhappy! And along with this feeling there was another&mdash;the
natural shrinking of a proud woman from laying bare the
hidden secrets of her soul, pure though they be, to mortal sight.
A woman does not want to tell her husband, the man who loves
her, and believes her irresistible to all, that another man has
been proof against her charms, that the first pure waters of
love's perennial fountain had gushed at the touch of another,
who let the tide flow on unheeding and uncaring, and a man
has no business to ask it. But where does the line of man's
"little brief authority" cross its boundaries? We have never
found out yet. It is left, perhaps, for some of the fair and
curious ones of our sex who are "strong-minded" in their "day
and generation" to solve that interesting problem.</p>

<p>So, Gracie, debarred by confession by so many and grave considerations,
in desperation, parried the question.</p>

<p>"Paul, do you know that I am sleepy and tired, while you
are keeping me up with such idle nonsense? If we must begin
at this late day to worry over our past loves and dreams, suppose
you begin first by telling me how many separate ladies
you loved before you ever met me! Come, begin with the first
on the list."</p>

<p>"It begins and ends with&mdash;yourself," he said, gravely and
firmly.</p>

<p>"Like the story of Mrs. Osgood's Evelyn," she rejoined,
smiling, and beginning to hum lightly:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"It began with&mdash;'My Evelyn fairest!'<br /></span>
<span class="i3">It ended with&mdash;'Evelyn best!'<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And epithets fondest and dearest,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Were lavished between on the rest."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Then breaking off, she says more seriously and softly:</p>

<p>"Then try to think that is the same with me. Don't worry
over such idle speculations. I am tired and half sick, dear."</p>

<p>"Gracie, you drive me to desperation. I asked you a simple
question&mdash;why do you try to evade it?"</p>

<p>"Because it is unfair to me. I haven't asked you any such
ridiculous questions. I won't submit to be catechised so, positively,
I won't! Don't be angry, dear. I am sure the slightest
reflection on your part will convince you that I am right. I
have partly forgotten the past; have ignored it anyhow, not
caring to look back any further in my life than the two years in
which I have known and loved you. All the happiness I ever
really knew has been showered on me by your lavish hand. Be
content in knowing that and spare me, Paul."</p>

<p>"I thank you, Grace, for your sweet tribute to me, but I asked
you a question and I am&mdash;waiting for your answer."</p>

<p>"I thought I had answered you plainly enough, Paul. Why
will you persist in making us both unhappy?"</p>

<p>"Gracie, will you answer or not?"</p>

<p>"Oh, darling! you have worried me into a nervous chill. I
am cold as ice," and to prove the truth of her words she pressed
two icy little hands upon his cheek, and for the first time in his
life he pushed his fairy away from him.</p>

<p>"You must not trifle with me, Grace."</p>

<p>"You still insist on it, Paul?"</p>

<p>"I still insist on it."</p>

<p>"At the risk of your own unhappiness?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>She looked at him sadly as she leaned across the crib near
him, but not touching him.</p>

<p>"Paul," she ventured, suddenly, "even supposing that I had
loved another before I ever met you, what difference can that
make to you? I love you truly now."</p>

<p>"So much difference, my wife, that I think I could never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
again be happy if I knew you had ever loved another than myself;
but I cannot bear this suspense. I ask you nothing about
other men. I only ask you, <i>did</i> you ever love Bruce Conway?"</p>

<p>She could not utter a falsehood; she could not escape his
keen, persistent questioning; she must be frank with him
and hope for the best. That was the only way the poor little
heart reasoned then; so with down-dropped eyes, and a sound
in her ears that recalled the whisper of the ocean in her ears
one parting night, she drew a little farther away from him, and
answered, in a hushed, low voice, much like a chidden child's:</p>

<p>"<i>I did.</i>"</p>

<p>A silence fell between them so hushed that she could hear her
own heart beat. He had put up his hand to his face, and she
could not see his features nor guess what effect her words had
on him.</p>

<p>"Paul," she ventured, almost frightened at the sound of her
own voice in the stillness, "don't think of it any more. I was
nothing but a simple, dreaming child, and it is just as natural
for a young girl to fancy herself in love with the first handsome
young man who flatters her as it is for our baby there in his
crib to cut his teeth and have the measles when he grows older.
It seems absurd to make yourself miserable over so trifling a
thing. I didn't like him so very much, indeed I didn't. I soon
learned how unworthy he was of any woman's love. He is a
fickle, wavering, unprincipled man, who never knows his own
mind, unworthy a second thought of yours, my noble husband."</p>

<p>Unflattering verdict! but a true one. She understood the
man who had trifled with her young heart almost better than
he did himself. In that time when he had wavered so fatally
between his pride and his happiness she had fathomed his very
soul with her suddenly awakened perceptions, and she understood
him well. She could look back now and thank Heaven
for what had seemed then a calamity scarcely to be borne.
What it had cost her only Heaven knew, for in her way she was
a proud woman, and never "wore her heart on her sleeve;"
but nobody stops to question how hard a struggle has been so
that victory crowns it at last. To the world it matters little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
who of its toiling, striving atoms have been patient pilgrims to</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i14">"That desert shrine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which sorrow rears in the black realm&mdash;Despair!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>so that they return with palms of victory in their hands and
the cross of honor upon their breasts. And Gracie, too, had
fought a battle in her life and conquered; if it left ineffaceable
scars they were hidden in her heart and left no token upon her
fair, inscrutable face.</p>

<p>He made no reply to her wistful defense.</p>

<p>She went up to him and touched his hand with hers, still intent
on making peace with this proud, impatient spirit. He
only put her very gently but firmly away from him, and in a
moment after turned suddenly and left the room. She heard
him go down to his study, close his door, and fall heavily into a
chair.</p>

<p>Then her repressed impatience and anger broke out, as she
paced back and forth, like a spirit, in her flowing hair and long
white robe.</p>

<p>"The idiot! the madman! to come back here after all this
time, and throw the shadow of that unhappy love all over my
future life! Did he think that I had no pride? that I would
bear coldness, carelessness, neglect, and be glad to meet him
after four years had passed, and say yes to the question that in
all honor he should have asked before he went? I think I could
spurn him with my foot if he knelt before me again as he did to-night!"</p>

<p>How she scorned him! How superb she was in her just anger
and resentment! Her changeful eyes darkened and flashed with
pride, her lip curled, her cheek glowed, her light step seemed
to spurn the floor.</p>

<p>"Mamma, mamma!" The soft, frightened voice of her child,
waking suddenly from his rosy sleep, recalled her to herself. In
an instant she was by his side, bending over him, kissing his
brow, his lips, his hands, his hair, in a passion of grieving tenderness.</p>

<p>"My darling, my comfort, my pretty boy! I am so glad that
you <i>are</i> a boy! You will never know the pains, the penalties,
the trials and crosses of a woman's life. If you were a little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
girl, and I knew that if you lived you must bear all that I have
borne and must still endure, I could bear to see you dead rather
than live to say, as I have done: 'Mother, why didn't you let
me die when I was a little child?'"</p>

<p>The little clock on the marble mantel chimed out the hour of
three in soft musical notes. She lifted the child in her arms,
and, passing into her sleeping apartment, laid him down on her
own bed, for she never slept without her treasure in her arms.
Then, kneeling by his side, she whispered a brief, agonized petition
to Heaven before laying her tired form down in the snowy
nest of linen and lace.</p>

<p>When the soft summer dawn began to break faintly over the
earth, Paul Winans rose up from his tiresome vigils and stole
up stairs with a noiseless footstep that did not waken her from
her exhausted sleep. Her child nestled close to her heart, and
her lips, even in her fitful slumber, were pressed upon his brow
just as she had fallen asleep. The long curls of her golden hair
flowed over both, and wrapped them in a mantle of sunshine.
Her face wore a look of remembered pain and grief that went
to his heart, as kissing both so softly that they did not stir, he
laid a note upon the pillow, and went down the stairs and out
into the street.</p>

<p>A misty, overcast morning dawned gloomily after the night of
Mrs. Conway's ball. In spite of it the lady rose early. She
had not slept at all, and, nervous and depressed, she roamed
over the disordered house, from which the servants were busily
removing the <i>debris</i> of the evening's entertainment. Every moment
she expected to see her nephew enter, and as the day wore
on and he failed to present himself, her impatience brooked
control no longer, and she sent a messenger into Norfolk to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
National Hotel, his usual stopping-place in the city, to inquire
after him.</p>

<p>The boy's swift horse carried him into the city and back in two
hours. He came into the lady's presence bowing and grinning,
the very picture of a sleek, good-natured, well-fed darkey.</p>

<p>"Did you see him, John?"</p>

<p>"Yaas'm, I see him," grinned John, his hands in his pockets
complacently jingling the nickels his young master had just bestowed
on him.</p>

<p>"You gave him my message? What did he say?"</p>

<p>"Yaas'm; he say as how"&mdash;here John stopped jingling his
nickels long enough to make a low dip of his woolly head, as
befitting the proper deliverance of the message he had&mdash;"he
will do heself de hon'r ob takin' tea wid you dis even."</p>

<p>"Was that all he said?"</p>

<p>"All he says to you, ma'am&mdash;he ast me how come I stay 'long
wid ole mis' all dis time, and not go off like do rest of de little
nigs? I tell him&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Here John stopped to chuckle softly at the remembrance.</p>

<p>"Well, you told him what?"</p>

<p>"As how old mis' couldn't git 'long 'thout me nohow," and
here John turned and made a hasty exit in obedience to a "Go
along, you impudent little monkey!" from the said "ole mis'."</p>

<p>He was at the gate that evening, ready to take his master's
horse when he cantered up in the gloom of the overcast sunset.</p>

<p>"Glad to see you, Marse Bruce. Hopes you've come to stay.
De ole place nuvver seemed like home without you," said the
young darkey, who as a boy had blacked Bruce Conway's boots,
run his errands, served as an escape-valve for all his ill humors,
and withal adored him, now welcoming him home with the
hearty affection that was so deeply rooted in his simple nature.</p>

<p>Freedom had not spoiled John in the least&mdash;possibly because
so far as kind treatment and almost unlimited indulgence went,
he had been <i>free</i> all his life.</p>

<p>But the young man merely threw him the reins, and with a
careless "Take good care of him, John," walked off in the direction
of the house.</p>

<p>"Humph!" commented the merry little darkey, as he led
the horse off to the stable. "Sulky! I dersay he's come to give<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
the madam fits for lettin' of his sweetheart git married afore he
come back. Serves him right, though. Why didn't he marry
her fust, and take her 'long wid him to that furrin parts? Poor,
pretty little dear! she did look just like an angel las' night, and
they do say Marse Bruce took on some when he seen her."</p>

<p>For the servants had all been woefully disappointed when
Bruce hurried off to Europe without the grand wedding that the
cook had prophesied would take place between himself and Miss
Grey; and the story of the last night's <i>contretemps</i> having been
duly rumored from parlor to kitchen, was the all-absorbing subject
of comment between cook, chambermaid, and boy-of-all-work&mdash;their
sympathies and indignation being in such a fluctuating
state just now that they could hardly decide who was the
most deserving of their sympathy&mdash;the young man who, as
they phrased it, had gone off and apparently jilted his sweetheart,
or the young lady whom he had returned to find had
really jilted him.</p>

<p>And the young man who was furnishing food for so much
feminine gossip and conjecture that day, quite heedless of it all,
walked on up the steps and into the stately presence of his expectant
aunt.</p>

<p>She came forward very cordially, concealing any possible annoyance
she felt under an appearance of affection. She began
to see that reproaches and anger were not the way to bring this
vacillating, reckless young fellow to his senses.</p>

<p>"I trust you are feeling well after your fatigue of last evening,"
he pleasantly observed, as they shook hands.</p>

<p>"No, I cannot say that I am. I have had no sleep, and felt
worried and anxious about you, my dear boy."</p>

<p>"I am sorry to have caused you any such annoyance," he
answered, repentantly, throwing himself wearily among the
cushions of a luxurious sofa&mdash;"very sorry, indeed, Aunt Conway.
I am not worth being a source of anxiety to any one."</p>

<p>The inflection of sadness and weariness in his tone touched
her heart, and swept away all lingering resentments. She looked
at him as he lay among the bright embroidered cushions, looking
so handsome, yet so worn and hopeless, and her womanly
pity found vent in the simple words:</p>

<p>"My poor boy!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span></p>

<p>"Don't pity me!" he answered, impatiently. "I am not deserving
of pity, and I don't want it. A man must sink very low,
indeed, to become the object of a woman's pity."</p>

<p>What a strange mood he was in! Accustomed to him as she
was, she could not fathom him this evening. She folded her
hands in her lap and looked at him wistfully. He grew restless
under her gaze, shifting his position so that the light should not
strike on his features.</p>

<p>"You sent for me to give me a scolding, I suppose," he said,
with a short, dry laugh. "I am here to receive it."</p>

<p>"I did not," she answered. "I sent for you because this is
your home, and I want you to stay with me if you will. It is
very lonely here with no one of my kindred, Bruce, and I am
getting to be quite an old woman now. Why cannot you give
me the solace of your company and affection for my few remaining
years?"</p>

<p>"My affection!"</p>

<p>No words can do justice to the reckless cynicism of his look
and tone.</p>

<p>"Aunt Conway, I have very little affection to give any one.
My heart seems dead in my bosom. I came home, so full of
noble resolves, so full of hope, that my downfall has almost
banished reason from its throne. And as for my company, I fear
I cannot even give you that. I owe it to myself, to you, more
than all to the wife of Senator Winans, to take myself away from
here, where no sight of me can recall my injustice to her, and
my crowning folly of last night."</p>

<p>"Bruce!"</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"You shall not talk so&mdash;shall not leave me again. Let Mrs.
Winans alone. You have been in banishment three&mdash;nay, four
years for her already. You shall not go again. Norfolk is
surely large enough for you two to live in without crossing the
path of each other. As for what happened last night, it is rather
mortifying, but it will soon be forgotten. Stay with me, Bruce;
there are plenty of beauties in Norfolk who will soon teach you
to forget Mrs. Winans."</p>

<p>"Forget her! Is it likely, when the prevailing topic of Norfolk
is the lovely Mrs. Winans, the brilliant Mrs. Winans, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
accomplished Mrs. Winans, with her accomplishments of fashion
and folly? It seems quite the fashion to talk about her now.
No, Aunt Conway, you cannot dissuade me from my purpose. I
shall go away from here until I can learn to be a man. Here I
renounce my ill-fated love for her, and pledge myself to forget
her as an honorable man should do."</p>

<p>His aunt looked at him, her regret and pain mingled with admiration.
He looked so noble, so proud, so manly as he spoke,
that for a moment she felt a pang at the thought of the wrong
she had done; for that she had done wrong she knew full well.
She had known of her nephew's passionate love for Grace Grey
and knew that with her he would have found all the happiness
that is vouchsafed to mortals. But for a scruple of worldly pride
and position she had separated them, punishing herself thereby;
for in the long years of his banishment she had felt too truly
that she had, in tearing apart those two loving hearts, bitterly
wounded her own. The repressed longing for her boy, the
pain of knowing herself unloved and uncared for, had been a
daily thorn in her heart, a wound</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"No after gladness<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Could ever wholly heal."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>For a moment, as she looked at him in his manly beauty and
brave renunciation, a better impulse stirred her heart, and
thinking of the fair young creature who had made such sunlight
in this dreary, splendid home, a vague wish came into her soul
that she had let them have their way, and not so rudely sundered
what God had joined together.</p>

<p>Too late! When we take it upon ourselves to shape the life-destinies
of others we must not expect to undo our work when
we find it completed and unsatisfactory to us. When we see the
hearts that our intermeddling has bruised and torn go from us
hungry and empty we must not expect them to turn to us for
the happiness we denied them.</p>

<p>Oh, fathers and mothers, maneuvering sisters, aunts, and relatives,
when the young birds are mating and building, why cannot
you let them alone? Why cannot you understand that your
special experience and wisdom were given you by God for your
guidance alone, and that every one cannot walk the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
chalked-out path, that every thinking, living mind must choose
for itself whether or not it be wisely or well?</p>

<p>"As we make our beds we lie" has passed into a truth, but is
it likely that any other will make it better for us than we try to
do for ourselves? To be plain, no one has a right to dictate to
us the way we are to walk in life; or, if they have, why has
God given to every one of us thinking, reasoning, yearning
minds, capable of knowing what we want and what we need
better than any one can know for us?</p>

<p>"Bruce," she said, gently, "I have wronged you, you
know. It was wrong of me to tempt you with my gold to desert
the girl you loved, and who loved you. I never felt until this
hour how basely I had acted. If I could undo my work I
would. But I trust you may yet find happiness, and that the
memory of all this suffering may pass from your soul as rain-drops
from a rose, leaving it brighter and lovelier after the
storm."</p>

<p>"Nay," he said, smiling faintly and sadly, "since you have
descended to simile, let me remind you that there are two sides
thereto. How often have I seen in this lovely garden of yours
the crushed rose-leaves covering the ground, rain-beaten, pallid,
and torn, as the storm had passed and left them. So it is most
likely to be with me."</p>

<p>"I trust not. At any rate, Bruce, I ask your forgiveness. It
is asking much, I know, when I reflect that but for me you
would have wedded the girl you loved, and who, through my
fault, is irrevocably lost to you. But you are all I have to love&mdash;all
I have to love! Don't deny me."</p>

<p>"I do not," he answered, slowly. "Don't blame yourself
entirely Aunt Conway. Blame my weak, wavering, vacillating
will, that made me hesitate between Grace Grey and the noble
inheritance you offered me. We are about equal, I think. I
sold myself&mdash;you bought me!"</p>

<p>Oh, Grace, you are avenged! Deeply as you scorned him
your contempt was not deeper than that which in this hour he
felt for himself.</p>

<p>"I thank you, Bruce, dear boy, that you do not accord me
all the blame, though I feel I fully deserve it. Let us change
the subject to one more pleasant."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span></p>

<p>"In one moment, but first I have a confession to make. You
may hear it from others, so I would like you to hear it first
from me. You know that I am truthful, though unstable, and
you can believe just what I say&mdash;not all the varnished reports
you may hear."</p>

<p>"Go on," she said anxiously, as he paused.</p>

<p>"Well, then, I left you last night in a bad state of mind. I
was mad, I think&mdash;simply mad&mdash;and in Norfolk I took more
wine than was good for me. I swore to myself that I would not
give up Grace. I hated her husband for having won her&mdash;I
hated the child that calls <i>her</i> mother and <i>him</i> father&mdash;I hated
you for separating us, and I swore that as she had loved me
once she should love me again. Under the influence of this
madness I took a guitar and sung under the window of the
grand Winans' mansion a love-song&mdash;yes, aunt," laughing a little
as she recoiled in dismay, "I dared to sing a love-song&mdash;I
dared to serenade the married belle of society and queen of
beauty with a love-song she had sung for me on the eve of our
parting four years ago."</p>

<p>"Oh, Bruce! what have you done?"</p>

<p>"Gotten myself into a difficulty, perhaps. The question is,
did they hear me, or were they all asleep? If they heard and
know me, I have undoubtedly provoked the wrath of that
haughty Senator who calls her his own. I propose to extricate
myself from this dilemma by leaving the place as quietly as I
returned; not through cowardice, Aunt Conway, I won't have
you think that," his eye flashed proudly, "but because I have
caused her trouble enough already. I'll not stay here to bring
further trouble and comment upon her. I won't have her pure
name dragged through the scandal of an affair of honor. The
only thing is to go away&mdash;that is the only reparation I can make,
to go away and forget her, and be myself forgotten."</p>

<p>There was much that was noble in him yet; much that
was high-toned, chivalric, high-spirited, and tender&mdash;all of it,
alas, marred by that vacillating will, that wavering, doubting
nature that was so long in making its mind up, and when made
up soon changed it again.</p>

<p>The tea-bell suspended further converse on the subject. He
gave her his arm in courtly fashion, and they descended to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
dining-room, both too preoccupied to observe the curious
kindly black faces that peeped at them from obscure stations,
eager to see the handsome young master they remembered so
well, and to see how he looked "since he'd come back and
found his sweetheart married and gone," as if people wore their
hearts in their faces. Ah, if they did what a gruesome looking
crowd would meet us whithersoever we went.</p>

<p>Dainty and elegant as was the evening meal, I think Bruce
Conway and his handsome old aunt scarcely did justice to it.
Her callous, worldly heart was stirred as it had not been for
years. For Bruce, I think he might as well have eaten chips
for all he enjoyed the spring chicken, the pickled oysters, the
rosy ham, and warmly-browned biscuit, the golden honey and
preserves, the luscious fruits, the fragrant tea and chocolate.
Across the glimmer of flowers, and silver, and dainty cut-glass,
and edibles, a shadowy form sat in the vacant chair at the opposite
side of the table, which had been the wonted place of the
rosy reality. A girl's fair face looked across at him, her white
hands trifled with the silver knife and fork, reached the preserve
across to him, poured the cream into his tea, showed him
a dozen kindly attentions, and once he said, absently, "No, I
thank you, Grace," and looked up into the shiny black face of
John, who was changing his plates for him, and who nearly
exploded with repressed laughter, but said, with mock earnestness,
and a pretense of misapprehension:</p>

<p>"Ole mis' nuvver say Grace afore meals, Marse Bruce, cepen'
'tis when de minister stays to tea, sir."</p>

<p>"Leave the room, you young scamp," said Mr. Conway, irascibly,
and John went, nothing loth to indulge himself in a fit of
laughter at the expense of his beloved young "Marse Bruce."
But the little incident served to make Bruce more wide-awake,
and rousing himself to realities the pansy-eyed phantom fled
away from Mrs. Conway's well-appointed table.</p>

<p>"That boy is a perfect clown," complained the lady; "he's
not fit to wait on the table at all. I shall have to secure a good
dining-room servant."</p>

<p>Mrs. Conway had said this so often that there was small danger
of its being put into execution. She was attached in a great
degree to the servants around her, all of whom had belonged to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
her in the days of slavery, and who when "set free," during the
war, had, unlike the majority of the freedmen who sought new
homes, promptly taken service at extravagant wages from their
whilom mistress and owner. John had grown up to his seventeenth
year in the service of his indulgent "ole miss," and he was
fully persuaded of the interesting fact that she "couldn't do
'thout him, nohow."</p>

<p>After tea the two repaired to the brightly lighted drawing-room.
The dull damp day rendered the closed shutters rather
agreeable than otherwise, and shut out thus, from the sight of
much that would have pained him, the young man made an
effort to entertain his aunt, narrating many of his adventures
abroad, and interesting an unthought-of listener, who was lazily
curled up outside the door listening to the sprightly converse of
the returned traveler.</p>

<p>"Wonder if all dat <i>kin</i> be true," pondered John, dubiously;
"but course 'tis, if Marse Bruce says so. John Andrew Jackson
Johnson, you ain't fitten to be a Conway nigger if you can't believe
what your young gentleman tells," and thus apostrophizing
himself, John relapsed into silence. Nevertheless, his
mouth and eyes during the next hour were often extended to
their utmost capacity, and I fear that if any other than Bruce
Conway had presumed to relate such remarkable things, John
would have been tempted to doubt his veracity.</p>

<p>A sharp peal of the door-bell compelled him to forego his
pleasant occupation to answer it. He came back with a card on
a silver salver.</p>

<p>"Gentl'man to see Marse Bruce; showed him into libr'y, sir;
he wished to see you 'lone, sir," announced John, with much
dignity.</p>

<p>Mr. Conway took the card, and Mrs. Conway looked over his
shoulder.</p>

<p>"Captain Frank Fontenay, U. S. A.," he read aloud, and
Mrs. Conway said:</p>

<p>"A military gentleman&mdash;who is he, Bruce? I don't know
him."</p>

<p>"Nor I," said her nephew, grimly.</p>

<p>He was white as marble, but his dark eyes never wavered in
their firm, cold glitter. Whatever else he was, Bruce Conway<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
was not a coward. He gently released himself from his aunt's
detaining hand.</p>

<p>"I will go and see this gentleman," he said.</p>

<p>"Oh, Bruce!"&mdash;she clung to him in a nervous, hysterical
tremor&mdash;"I feel as if something dreadful were going to happen.
Don't see him at all."</p>

<p>He smiled at her womanly fears.</p>

<p>"My dear aunt, don't be hysterical. John, call Mrs. Conway's
maid to attend her. Aunt Conway, there is nothing to
alarm you&mdash;nothing at all;" and, putting her back on her sofa,
he went out to meet his unbidden guest.</p>

<p>The captain was a fine-looking man, of perhaps forty years,
blue-eyed, blonde-haired, and much be-whiskered. He stood
very courteously in the middle of the floor, hat in hand, as
Bruce entered the library.</p>

<p>"Mr. Conway?" he interrogated, smoothly.</p>

<p>"At your service, sir," said Bruce.</p>

<p>"Mr. Conway," said the gentleman, with a glittering smile that
showed all his lovely white teeth, "I am the bearer to you of a
message from Senator Winans. My friend, sir, considers himself
insulted by you, and demands such satisfaction as all gentlemen
accord each other."</p>

<p>He placed an open note in Mr. Conway's hand, who silently
perused it.</p>

<p>It was a challenge to fight a duel.</p>

<p>"Any friend of yours can call on me to-morrow at three to
settle the preliminaries," suggested the blonde captain, placidly
smiling up into Mr. Conway's impassive face, and taking his acceptance
for granted.</p>

<p>"Very well, sir; I will send a friend of mine to you quite
punctually at three to-morrow. Is that satisfactory for the
present?"</p>

<p>"Quite so, sir; very much so, sir," smoothly returned Captain
Fontenay, bowing his quite imposing military presence out.</p>

</p>


<p>Grace Winans waked from her troubled sleep with a vague
presentiment of impending evil. She heard the small clock
on the mantel chiming seven, and looked about her half bewildered.</p>

<p>The shaded taper burned faintly in the room, and the gray
morning light stole dimly through the closed shutters and lace
curtains. Her baby lay on her arm, sleeping sweetly in his
warm white nest. She raised her head a little, only to sink
back wearily with a dull, fevered throbbing in her temples,
and a sharp pang of remembrance that forced a low cry from
her lips:</p>

<p>"Oh, Paul!"</p>

<p>Where was he? She thought of the study, and with a pang
at fancy of his tiresome vigil, eased the baby lightly off her arm,
and tucking him softly round, donned dressing-gown and slippers,
and stole gently down stairs, rapped slightly at the door,
then opened it and entered.</p>

<p>The light still burned in the room, looking garish and wan in
the pale beams of morning; the easy-chair was drawn near the
writing-table, but vacant. She glanced around her. He was
not there, and no trace of him remained.</p>

<p>The young wife slowly retraced her steps.</p>

<p>"He will come presently," she whispered to herself, "but I
wonder where he is;" and as she bent over little Paul, laying
her round, white arm on the pillow, the sharp edge of the note
grazed her velvet-like skin. She looked at it, shrinking, afraid,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
it seemed, to touch it for the moment; then, with a terrible
effort over herself, her trembling hand took it up, her shady,
violet eyes ran over the contents:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Oh Grace!" it read, "you know that I adore you&mdash;too well, too
well! for I cannot bear to live with you and know that your heart&mdash;the
heart I thought so wholly and entirely mine&mdash;has ever held the
image of another! You should have told me of this before we married.
You wronged me bitterly, Gracie, but I will not upbraid you. Still,
until I can learn to curb this jealous passion of mine, I will not, cannot
remain where you are. I should only render you miserable. You
and my boy will remain in my home&mdash;remember, I command this&mdash;and
you will draw on my banker as usual for what sums you may need
or want. I do not limit you in anything, my wife, my own idolized
wife&mdash;please yourself in all things, do as you like, and try to be content
and happy. If I can ever overcome this jealous madness&mdash;can
ever reconcile myself to knowing that I was <i>second</i> instead of first in
your pure heart, I will come to you, but not till then. Try to be
happy with our little boy, and forgive your own, erring, unhappy</p>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">Paul</span>."<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>White and still as marble, the deserted wife sat holding that
mad note in her hand, looking before her into vacancy, moveless,
speechless&mdash;yes, and pallid as she would ever be in her
coffin.</p>

<p>A terrible, overwhelming sense of her desolation rushed upon
her; but, strangely enough, her first thoughts were not of her
husband in his jealous grief, but of herself&mdash;of the scandal, the
disgrace, the nine-days' wonder that would follow all this. She
knew her husband well enough to know that once his mad
resolve was taken it would be adhered to.</p>

<p>He was no Bruce Conway, with wavering, doubting will, that
could be blown aside by a passing breeze. Firm, proud, sensitive,
but unbending as adamant, was Paul Winans when once
his resolution was taken. No one knew it better than his wife,
though he had ever been kind and loving to her.</p>

<p>A dumb horror settled on her soul as she realized the meaning
of his letter. He blamed her as having willfully deceived
him. She had not meant to do so; she had not thought it a
matter of any moment to Paul Winans whether or not she had
loved before she met him. Other men would not have cared&mdash;why<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
should he? He had not questioned her, had taken her past
for granted. How could she tell him of that unsought, scorned,
neglected love that had darkly shadowed the joy of her young
girlhood? He was unjust to her. She felt it keenly in the
midst of her sufferings.</p>

<p>Were all men like these two whom she had loved, she questioned
herself, mournfully. Not one of them was worthy of a
true woman's love&mdash;no, not one.</p>

<p>It had come to this&mdash;a deserted wife&mdash;through no fault of
hers was this tribulation brought on her. She felt that the
world had used her hardly and cruelly. The passion and pride that
underlie firm yet sweet natures like hers, surged up to the surface
and buoyed her up above the raging billows of grief and sorrow.
She felt too indignant to weep. She had almost wept her
heart out long ago. She meant to sit still with folded hands
and tranquil heart, and let the cold, harsh world go by heedless
of its pangs, as it was of hers.</p>

<p>Her husband was using her cruelly in bringing this unmerited
disgrace upon her and her child. She half resolved to flee
far away with her boy where he could never find her in the hour
when shame and repentance should drive him back to her side.
It was but for a moment. Then she remembered the brief sentence
in his note that commanded her to remain in his home,
and then her resolution wavered; for when Grace Grey had
taken that solemn oath before God to "love, honor, and <i>obey</i>,"
she had meant to keep her word.</p>

<p>Poor child! for hers was a strangely complex nature&mdash;a blending
of the child and woman that we often meet in fine, proud
feminine natures, and never wholly understand.</p>

<p>A hundred conflicting emotions surged madly through her as
she sat there, motionless and pale, until moment after moment
went by, and the overtaxed brain, the overwrought heart gave
way, and blessed unconsciousness stole upon her. With her
hands folded loosely in her lap over that cruel note, a sharp despair
shadowed forth in that lovely face, the stately head fell forward
and rested heavily on the pillow beside the child, whose
rosy, unconscious slumber was unbroken, as though the hovering
wings of angels brooded above him and his forsaken mother.</p>

<p>Norah found her thus when the cooing voice of the awakened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
babe reached her ears in the nursery. His pretty black eyes
were sparkling with glee, his rosy lips prattled baby nothings,
his dimpled, white fingers were twisted in the bright curls of
his mother's hair as they swept luxuriantly over the pillow.</p>

<p>With all the art of his babyhood he was trying to win a response
from his strangely silent mother.</p>

<p>She came back to life with a gasping sigh, as Norah dashed a
shower of ice-water into her face, opened her eyes, said, "Don't,
Norah, don't!" and drifted back to the realms of unconsciousness;
and so deep was the swoon that this time all the restoratives
of the frightened Norah failed for a long time of any effect.</p>

<p>"Looks like she's dead!" muttered the Irishwoman, divided
between her care for the child's mother and the child itself, who
began to grow fretful from inattention and hunger.</p>

<p>Better for her if she had been, perhaps. There are but few
women who find the world so fair that the grave is not held as a
refuge for their tired souls and bodies. But Grace came back,
with a little gasping sigh, to the life that had never held much
attraction for her, and with a trembling arm drew her baby to
her breast.</p>

<p>"Poor little Paul!" she quavered, "he is hungry and fretful.
Go and get his bath ready, Norah. I can't think how I
came to faint. I feel well enough now, and it is quite unusual
to me to lose consciousness so easily."</p>

<p>She was herself again. Pride sat regnant on her brow, on her
curling lip, in her quiet eyes. It held her up when the poor
heart felt like breaking. She had learned the lesson long ago&mdash;learned
it too thoroughly to forget.</p>

<p>So the day passed quietly away. She had briefly explained
to the curious servants that their master had been called off by
an emergency that required his absence from home. She did
not know at what time he would return&mdash;he did not know himself
yet. In the meantime all would go on in the house as
usual. And with this miserable subterfuge, for which she
despised herself, the young wife tried to shield her husband's
name from the sharp arrows of censure.</p>

<p>Two or three visitors were announced that evening, but she
quietly declined seeing company; and so one of the longest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
days of her life wore to its close, as even the longest, dreariest
days will, if we only have patience to wait.</p>

<p>She was not patient, nor yet impatient. A dull, reckless
endurance upheld her in that and succeeding days of waiting
that passed the same. She heard nothing from her husband.
In the excited, unnatural state of her mind, smarting under the
sense of injustice and wrong, it seemed to her that she did not
care to hear.</p>

<p>She spent her time altogether with her little son, never seeing
company nor going out. When Norah took the child out for
his daily airing and ride through the fresh air, she whiled away
the time till his return by reckless playing on the grand piano
or organ, in the elegant drawing-room. She could not settle
herself to reading, sewing, or any other feminine employment.
She filled up the great blank that had come into her life as best
she might with the sublime creations of the old masters.</p>

<p>Sometimes the very spirit of mirth and gayety soared in
music's melting strains from the grand piano; sometimes the
soul of sadness and despair wailed along the organ chords, but
the fair face kept its changeless, impassive calm through all,
while the white fingers flew obedient to her will. Sometimes
she tried to sing, but the spirit of song was wanting.
She could not even sing to her child, could scarcely speak, and
started sometimes at the hollow echo of her own sweet voice.</p>

<p>And thus a dreary week passed away. But even this semblance
of calm and repose was destined to be rudely broken.
Miss Lavinia Story effected an entrance one day, being determined
not to be kept out any longer by the stereotyped "not
at home;" and with her tenderest smile she took both hands of
Mrs. Winans in hers, and looked with deep solicitude into her
calmly beautiful face.</p>

<p>"Dear friend, you must forgive me for this intrusion, but I
felt that I must see you, must condole with you in your trying
situation. You are very pale, my dear, looking wretched I
may say, but you bear up well, remarkably well, I think, considering
everything."</p>

<p>Mrs. Winans invited her visitor to a seat with freezing politeness
and hauteur. Then she went back to her place on the
music-stool.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span></p>

<p>"I was playing when you came in," she remarked, coolly.
"If you will tell me what music you like, Miss Lavinia, I will
play for you."</p>

<p>"Not for the world would I lacerate your feelings so much,"
sighed the old maid, putting her lace handkerchief to her eyes
to wipe away a tear that was not there. "What, when all Norfolk
is sympathizing with you in your distress and mortification,
and commiserating you, shall I be heartless enough to beg
you to play for me, even though you are bearing up so sweetly
and wonderfully. No, my love, don't exert yourself for me.
I understand your feelings, and only wish to sympathize with
you&mdash;not to be a source of annoyance."</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, Miss Lavinia"&mdash;the soft eyes looked
gravely at her, the fair face keeping its chilling calm, the musical
voice its polite indifference&mdash;"I did not know myself so
honored by the good people of Norfolk, and really, I must say
their commiseration is wasted in a bad cause, and I do not
know what has given them occasion for its exercise. When I
need sympathizers and 'Job's comforters,' I will seek them.
At present I do not feel their need."</p>

<p>"Dear me! how high and mighty Mrs. Conway's companion
has got to be," thought Miss Lavinia, spitefully, but she only
said: "My dear, I am glad to see you bear up so well. Your
strength of mind is quite remarkable. Now, had such a thing
happened to me I feel sure I should have been extremely ill
from shame and terror. But," with a simper, "I am such a
timid, nervous girl. With your beauty and notoriety you have
no doubt grown accustomed to this kind of thing, and do not
mind it. But my sympathy is truly great for your little boy."</p>

<p>"Miss Story!"&mdash;her hostess whirled around on the music-stool,
an ominous fire blazing under her long dark lashes&mdash;"I
pass over your contemptible innuendoes to myself as unworthy
my notice, but will you kindly inform me what you are talking
about&mdash;that is if you know yourself, for I assuredly do not."</p>

<p>What superb anger there was in her look and tone. It was
scarcely like her to be so irritable, but she was not herself this
evening. The tamed leopard, when goaded too hard, sometimes
turns on its keeper, and the gentlest heart has a spark of
fire smoldering in its depths that may be rudely stirred into a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
destructive flame. Miss Lavinia recoiled timorously from the
fire that blazed in those wondrous dark eyes.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, Mrs. Winans," she answered, smoothly.
"I did not know you were so angry about it, though, of course,
you feel irritated about it, as every right-minded person must
feel. I think myself Mr. Conway has acted unbecomingly.
You had a right to change your mind in his absence if you
liked, and it <i>was</i> silly in him to make such ado about it all,
when the best plan was to let it all blow over."</p>

<p>"Do you mean to insinuate that I was affianced to Mr. Conway
during his absence, and threw him over for a wealthier
rival, Miss Story?" demanded Grace, indignantly.</p>

<p>"That is what rumor assigns as the cause of the late 'unpleasantness,'
to call it by a mild name," returned the persevering
spinster, carefully taking down mental notes of the conversation
to report to her gossips.</p>

<p>"Then rumor is, as usual, mistaken. Mr. Conway never has
been, never can be, more than the merest acquaintance to me,"
answered Mrs. Winans, briefly and coldly.</p>

<p>"Indeed! Thank you, my dear friend, for reposing such
implicit confidence in me. I am glad to know the truth of the
matter, and to be able to tell people that you are not the heartless
flirt they try to make you out. Mr. Conway's folly is indeed
reprehensible, and he no doubt deserves all he suffers."</p>

<p>All he suffers! The pale listener wondered if he suffered half
so much as she did. What was his selfish disappointment to
the disgrace, the trouble, the sorrow he had brought on her and
her innocent baby. Her heart hardened toward him as she listened.</p>

<p>"Let us drop the subject," she said, proudly. "Mr. Conway
is hardly worth being the protracted subject of our conversation.
It were better had he remained on the other side of the ocean."</p>

<p>"That's the truth," said Miss Lavinia, briskly. "The foolish
fellow. To come all the way home to be shot down for a woman
who never even cared for him, and a married woman at that."</p>

<p>"To be shot down did you say, Miss Story? I confess I do
not understand you. Will you explain yourself? You have
been talking in enigmas all this time."</p>

<p>Mrs. Winans rose from her seat, and taking a step forward,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
looked at the incorrigible old gossip, her red lips half apart, her
dusk-blue orbs alight, her whole appearance indicative of eager,
repressed excitement.</p>

<p>"Why, you seem surprised," said the spinster, maliciously.
"Why Mrs. Winans, didn't you know of the almost fatal termination
of the duel? Ah, that accounts for your calmness and
composure. I thought you were not utterly heartless. I see it
all. They have kept the papers from you."</p>

<p>"The duel! What duel?"</p>

<p>"Why, the duel between your husband and Bruce Conway,
to be sure," answered Miss Lavinia, in surprise at Grace's apparent
stupidity.</p>

<p>"Miss Story, do you mean to tell me that there has been a
duel between these two&mdash;my husband and Mr. Conway?"</p>

<p>"Why, certainly there has. Haven't I been talking about it
ever since I came in here? And is it possible that you knew
nothing at all of the affair?"</p>

<p>"I did not." Very low and sad fell the words from her white
lips, and she leaned one arm on the grand piano to steady her
graceful figure. "Miss Story, my husband&mdash;he was unhurt, I
trust?"</p>

<p>"He was not injured at all, and I hear has left the city, but
that unfortunate Mr. Conway fell at the first fire, and is very seriously
wounded, they say. Indeed, I believe the surgeon has
small hopes of his recovery. It's very sad, very shocking. It
ought to be a warning to all young men not to go falling in love
with other men's wives."</p>

<p>Go with me, my reader, not many squares distant from that
stately Winans' mansion, to an humbler home&mdash;a small brick<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
edifice standing near to the street, and bearing over a side-door
a small sign, with the name of Willard Clendenon, Attorney-at-law,
inscribed thereon in very handsome gilt letters. But we
have no business to transact with the gallant captain, so we will
not even look into his dusty office, but pass on up the stairs,
and without even knocking, enter the guest-chamber of the
house.</p>

<p>It is a large, airy, prettily appointed chamber, but the shutters
are closely akimboed, the lace curtains are drooped over
the windows, and the quiet air of a sick-room pervades the
apartment. On the low, white bed that occupies the center of
the apartment is the recumbent figure of a man, in whose handsome
features, even though his eyes are closed in a death-like
sleep, we recognize Bruce Conway. He looks like marble as he
lies there, his black hair flowing back from his broad, white
brow, his closed eyes encircled with purplish rings, the dark
mustache slightly shading his mouth, only revealing more
plainly the deathly pallor and suffering of the lips.</p>

<p>Standing by the side of the bed, Captain Clendenon looks
down at him with infinite pity and tenderness in his dark-gray
orbs.</p>

<p>And standing by the captain's side is a little figure that looks
fairy-like by contrast with his manly proportions. She clings
to his arm as he stands there, and her brown head leans lightly
against him, her fair girlish face wearing a look of sadness and
pain as she gazes at the sufferer's sleeping face.</p>

<p>"Oh, Brother Willie," she whispers, "I am so sorry for him!
Oh, it is so dreadful!"</p>

<p>And then her red lips quiver like a grieved child's, and two
pearly tears start on her cheeks, and, rolling down, are lost in
the ruffles on the breast of her blue morning-dress.</p>

<p>Captain Clendenon did not answer. He looked down at the
quiet, handsome face that the surgeon thought might never
wake from that death-like sleep, or if it did, it might only be to
take on the deeper sleep of eternity. He had lain like that all
day&mdash;it was noon now.</p>

<p>The duel had taken place a few days before, at a little distance
out of Norfolk. The captain had done everything in his
power to prevent the terrible affair, but in vain; had refused<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
the application of Bruce that he should become his second, in
the hope that he might be enabled to compromise the affair by
prevailing on Bruce to offer Winans an apology for his untimely
serenade.</p>

<p>Bruce had changed his mind about going away, and chose to
feel offended at the view taken by the captain of the whole
affair; so he left him out of his councils, and the duel came off
without the captain's knowledge or consent. A mere accident
had brought the matter to his knowledge at almost the hour
appointed for it, and hurrying off to the scene of action, he had
arrived only in time to see him fall at the first fire.</p>

<p>The appointed place was seven miles from Mrs. Conway's
residence, and after the surgeon had dressed the wound and
declared its serious nature, the captain took the right of an old
friend to convey him to his own home in Norfolk, which was
nearer, more especially as the surgeon thought the last lingering
hope of recovery would be destroyed by jolting him over seven
miles to his home at Ocean View.</p>

<p>That was how he came to be lying there in that pleasant
chamber, with Captain Clendenon's pretty sister crying her
brown eyes out over him.</p>

<p>"Poor boy! poor Bruce!" he murmured. "How the bitter
consequences of his wrong-doing has followed him! And now,
in all probability, he must die; yet, after all," thought this loyal
heart, "it cannot be so very hard to die for her."</p>

<p>The noiseless entrance of his pleasant-faced mother made him
look up. Taking a seat by the bed, she quietly dismissed them
from the room.</p>

<p>"I will watch by him myself," she said, kindly, "and the
fewer in the room the better, you know. Both of you go and
rest yourselves."</p>

<p>They both withdrew with lingering steps, and eyes that
seemed loth to quit that pale sleeper, but quietly obedient to
their mother's wishes, and content in knowing that she would
do for him all that lay in human power.</p>

<p>But down in the quiet little parlor the brother and sister sat
down to talk it all over.</p>

<p>"Oh, brother! what did Mrs. Conway say when you told
her?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span></p>

<p>"Went off into strong hysterics. The maid had to put her
to bed. I sent the doctor out there as I rode in town."</p>

<p>"How dreadful! all she had to love, poor, proud old lady;
how I pity her!" and the little maiden's tears flowed afresh
from her sympathizing soul.</p>

<p>"She may thank herself for the most of it," he answered, half
bitterly. "Why did she tempt his weak mind with her wealth
and pride? She knew better than any one else how wavering a
will was his. Why did she continually thwart all his best impulses?"</p>

<p>"But, brother, he ought to have had more manliness. But it
is too late to blame him now. I wonder if Mrs. Winans knows&mdash;how
she feels about it? Do you know, brother Willie, I
would give much to see this wonderful woman whose beauty
has only been for bane. You have seen her. Is she so very
beautiful? What is she like?"</p>

<p>"Like nothing you ever saw, little Lulu&mdash;like some fair saint,
or angel."</p>

<p>The passion in his heart broke through his words. A faint
red flushed his brown cheek, and his eyes drooped as his sister
looked up with soft, astonished gaze.</p>

<p>"Why, brother, did you love her, too?</p>

<p>"That is the first time you have accused me of loving any
one but yourself, little sister," he answered, lightly, parrying
the question.</p>

<p>"Well, tell me this, brother. Did you ever go to see her at
all? Did you like her&mdash;did she like you?"</p>

<p>"I went there sometimes&mdash;not often," his glance falling with
unconscious pathos on the empty sleeve that lay between him
and any aspiration toward woman's love. "I liked her very
much indeed. She was very sweet and attractive, very obliging
always. She liked me a little; I suppose, as a mere friend. I
never presumed to ask for a deeper regard. I knew she loved
Bruce. I felt, Lulu, it seemed to me then, in her dark days,
every pang that struck home to that trusting and deceived young
heart. I felt sorry for her, and admired her for the brave yet
womanly strength that carried her through that bitter ordeal.
I rejoiced with her when she married a better man than Bruce
and seemed to have forgotten the past."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span></p>

<p>The tender brown eyes looked gravely at him as he spoke,
reading his heart with a woman's quick intuition. She put both
arms about his neck and touched her lips to the noble brow over
which the brown curls fell so carelessly. The mute caress told
him that she understood and sympathized in his unspoken grief.
The man's heart in him could not bear it. He rose, putting her
kindly and gently aside.</p>

<p>"Lulu, she has a noble husband; a handsome, generous fellow,
a 'man among men,' but he is marred almost as much by
his unreasoning jealousy as is Bruce by his unstable character.
I pity her. She is worthy of confidence and all respect. It is
an honor to any man to have loved her even though hopelessly."</p>

<p>"And Senator Winans has left her, they say, Brother Willie?"</p>

<p>"So rumor says," he answered, meditatively.</p>

<p>"Why don't you see him, brother, and talk with him, and try
to make him look at things fairly? It seems a pity she should
suffer so, through no fault of hers, too. My heart aches for her
in her loneliness."</p>

<p>He did not answer. He was walking slowly up and down the
floor, pausing now and then to look out of the window which
overlooked the Elizabeth River and the wharves crowded with
the shipping of all nationalities. His sister rose and paced the
floor, also, her young heart full of sympathy for the four people
whose life-paths crossed each other so strangely and sadly. She
shuddered and hoped she would never love. Of the three men
who each loved Grace Winans in his own fashion, she wondered
which was the most unhappy; the husband who had stained his
hands in human blood for his selfish passion; Bruce Conway
who was dying for her, or her brother whose heart was silently
breaking for her. The little maiden who was all unversed in
the lore of life found herself bewildered in the maze of metaphysics
into which she was drifting. She sat herself down with
a sigh, and thought of the handsome face lying so deathly white
up stairs, and half wishing her mother had not banished her
from the room.</p>

<p>"Lulu!"</p>

<p>"Yes, Brother Willie."</p>

<p>He was looking at her as she looked up at him with a flitting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
blush on her round, dimpled face. She was wonderfully pretty,
this Lulu Clendenon, with her arch brown eyes, and pink and
white skin, the wavy brown hair that was gathered in a soft,
loosely braided coil at the back of her small head, and her blue
lawn dress, with its frillings, and flutings, and puffings, was
very becoming, setting off the whiteness of her throat and wrists
as no other color ever does for a pretty woman.</p>

<p>"Well," she said, as he did not answer her first reply.</p>

<p>"My little sister, I won't have you tangling your brain up
with useless speculations over things that must happen as long
as the world stands and men and women live, and breathe, and
have their being. Don't let me see that pretty brow all puckered
up again. What would mother and I do if our household fairy
became dull, and dreamy, and philosophical."</p>

<p>"Brother Willie, am I always to be a child?"</p>

<p>"Always, my sweet? Why how old are you&mdash;sixteen?"</p>

<p>"I am nineteen, brother, and this Mrs. Winans of whom all
Norfolk is raving, who is a wife and mother&mdash;she, it is said, is
barely more than twenty."</p>

<p>"Yes, love; but the loss of parents and friends forced Grace
Grey into premature womanhood and premature responsibilities;
she took up the cross early, but you, dear little one&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>A low tinkle of the door-bell cut short whatever else he meant
to say, and he answered the summons himself. It was a messenger
from Mrs. Conway to inquire concerning her nephew.
He sent back a message that he still lay sleeping quietly. For
the rest of the day the house was besieged with callers and inquirers
from all parts of the city, and Captain Clendenon found
himself kept busy in replying.</p>

<p>In the midst of it all, in his deep grief and anxiety for his
friend's life, in his pity and sympathy for the exiled duelist, a
fair face brooded over all his thoughts, a pang for a woman's
suffering struck coldly to his heart. To know that she was
mourning alone, bowed to earth in her unmerited sorrow and
shame, was the height and depth of bitterness to the man who
loved her tenderly and purely as he did his own little sister.</p>

<p>And the spring day wore to its close, and the silence of the
balmy spring night, with its wandering breeze of violets, its
mysterious stare, fell over all things. The string of inquirers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
from among the friends of the wounded man thinned out, the
surgeon came and went, and still Bruce Conway lay locked in
that strange pallid sleep on whose waking so many hearts hung
with anxiety and dread.</p>

<p>At ten o'clock the captain admitted John, who had come to
seek fresh tidings for his mistress. His honest black face
looked up in vague, awe-struck grief at the captain's mournful
features.</p>

<p>"Oh, marse cap'en!" he pleaded, "lemme see him, if you
please, sir, once more before he dies!"</p>

<p>"Be very quiet, then," said the captain, "and it will do no
harm for you to go in."</p>

<p>The black boy went in with footfalls noiseless as the captain's
own. Lulu and her mother were there, one on each side of the
bed, watching the sleeper with anxious eyes. They looked up
at the strange face of the boy as he paused and gazed at the
still, white face on the pillow. His dark skin seemed to grow
ashen white as he looked, his thick, ugly lip quivered convulsively,
and two tears darted from his black eyes and rolled
down upon his breast. He gazed long and mournfully, seeming
to take in every lineament of that beloved face; then, as he
turned reluctantly away, stooped carefully down, and touched
his rough lips tenderly and lightly on the cold, white hand that
lay outside of the coverlid.</p>

<p>"Twas a hand that never struck me, and was always kind
to me," he murmured, mournfully, as he went out, followed by
the injunction from Mrs. Clendenon to report that Mr. Conway
was still in the same condition&mdash;sleeping quietly.</p>

<p>Lulu looked down at the hand lying so still and lifeless on the
counterpane. A tear-drop that had fallen from the eyes of the
poor black boy lay on it, shining purely as a pearl in the subdued
light. Lulu would not wipe it away. It was a precious
drop distilled from the fountain of unselfish love and sorrow;
it seemed to plead mutely to the girl for the man who lay there
so still and pale, unable to speak for himself.</p>

<p>"There must have been much good in the poor young man,"
she thought, impulsively, "or his servants would not have loved
him like that."</p>

<p>By and by she stole down to her brother, who was still pacing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
with muffled footfalls, the parlor floor. He turned to her,
inquiringly.</p>

<p>"Well?" he queried.</p>

<p>"No change yet&mdash;not the slightest."</p>

<p>"Probably there will not be until midnight. I trust it will
be favorable, though we have no grounds to expect it. The surgeon
fears internal hemorrhage from that great bullet-wound in
the side&mdash;it narrowly escaped the heart. He will be here again
to-night before the crisis comes."</p>

<p>Once more comes a low, muffled door-bell. Lulu drops into
an arm-chair, shivering, though the night is warm. Willard
goes to the door.</p>

<p>Presently he comes back, ushering in a stranger. She rises
up, thinking as a matter of course that this is the surgeon.</p>

<p>"My sister, Lulu, Senator Winans," said her brother's quiet
tones.</p>

<p>Lulu nearly dropped to the floor in astonishment and terror.
She was very nervous to-night&mdash;so nervous that she actually
trembled when he lightly touched her hand, and she almost
pushed his away, thinking, angrily, that that firm white hand
had done Bruce Conway to death.</p>

<p>He was not so terrible to look at, though, she thought, as
with woman's proverbial curiosity she furtively scanned the
tall, fine figure.</p>

<p>He was very young to fill such a post of honor in his country&mdash;he
certainly did not look thirty&mdash;and the fine white brow,
crowned by curling, jet-black hair, might have worn a princely
crown and honored it in the wearing. Beautiful, dusk-black
eyes, gloomy now as a starless midnight, looked at her from
under slender, arched, black brows. The nose was perfectly
chiseled, of Grecian shape and profile; the mouth was flexible
and expressive&mdash;one that might be sweet or stern at will; the
slight, curling mustache did not hide it, though his firm chin
was concealed by the dark beard that rippled luxuriantly over
his breast.</p>

<p>It was a face that breathed power; whose beauty was thoroughly
masculine; that was mobile always; that might be proud,
or passionate, or jealous&mdash;never ignoble. Altogether he was a
splendidly handsome man. Lulu could not help acknowledging<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
this to herself&mdash;the very handsomest man she had ever seen in
her life. But for all that, after she had politely offered him a
chair, she retreated as far as possible from his vicinity. Why
had he come there in his proud, strong manhood and beauty,
and Bruce Conway lying up stairs like <i>that</i>? He did not take
the offered seat, but merely placing one hand on the back of it,
looked from her to her brother.</p>

<p>"I feel that this is an unwelcome intrusion, Captain Clendenon,"
he said, slowly, and in soft, sad tones, that thrilled the
girl's heart, in spite of the anger she felt for him, "but I cannot
help it, though you may not believe me when I tell you that it
was so impossible for me endure the suspense and horror of to-night
that I have come here to beg you for news of the man
whom I have almost murdered."</p>

<p>Black eyes and gray ones met each other without wavering.
Soul met soul, and read each other by the fine touchstone of a
fellow-feeling. Even in his anger for his friend, Willard Clendenon
could not withhold a merited kindly answer.</p>

<p>"I do believe you," he answered, quietly, "and am glad you
came, though I can tell you nothing satisfactory. The patient
has slept all day&mdash;still sleeps&mdash;&mdash; he will awaken to life or death.
We are only waiting."</p>

<p>"Waiting!" That word chilled the fiery, impulsive soul of
Paul Winans into a dumb horror. Waiting!&mdash;for what! To see
his work completed. What had he done? Taken in cold blood
a human life that at this moment, in his swift remorse and self-accusation,
he would have freely given his own to save; in the
height of his jealous madness committed a deed from which his
calmer retrospection revolted in horror. He looked from one to
the other in pale, impotent despair. He had gone his length&mdash;the
length of human power and passion&mdash;now God's hand held
the balance.</p>

<p>"Then, at least, you will let me wait," he said. "If he dies,
I shall surrender myself up to justice. If he lives, I shall all
the sooner know that I am not a murderer."</p>

<p>"You shall stay, certainly, and welcome," Willard said, cordially,
touched by the evident suffering of the other.</p>

<p>"Very well; I will sit here and wait, with thanks. I do not
deserve this kindness."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span></p>

<p>Lulu stole from the room, leaving them alone together, and
resumed her place up stairs. The patient slept calmly on, her
mother placidly watching him. Once or twice her brother
looked quietly in, and as quietly withdrew. There was something
on his mind that must be spoken. He turned once and
looked at his companion as he sat upright in his chair, still and
pale almost as his victim lay up stairs.</p>

<p>"Winans," he said, slowly, "we have known each other for a
long time, and I knew your wife long before you ever met her,
and knew her but to reverence her as a pearl among women.
Will you pardon me if I confess to an interest in her that lends
me to inquire frankly if you think you are doing her justice?"</p>

<p>"Clendenon, I know that I am not. I know that I am unworthy
of her&mdash;pure, injured angel that she is&mdash;but what can I
do? I dare not remain near her. I should but make her miserable.
It maddens me, in my jealous bitterness, when I remember
that young, fair, and sweet as she was when I first met
her, the pure page of her heart had already been inscribed with
the burning legend of a first love. Her first love lost to me, her
second only given to me, I cannot bear! When I can overcome
this fiery passion, and if Bruce Conway lives, I will return to
her&mdash;not till then."</p>

<p>"You are wrong, my friend&mdash;bitterly wrong. Think of what
she suffers, of the scandal, the conjecture that your course will
create. You should be her defender, not leave her defenseless
to meet the barbed arrows of caviling society. Return to your
injured wife, Winans. Take the candid advice of one who
esteems you both. It is so hard on her. She suffers deeply, I
feel."</p>

<p>"Clendenon, hush! You madden me, and cannot shake my
firm resolve&mdash;would that I had never met her."</p>

<p>"Possibly she might have been happier," Clendenon says,
with sudden scathing sarcasm, "but I will say no more. It is
not my province to come between man and wife. May God
have more mercy on her than you have!"</p>

<p>The words pierced that proud heart deeply. The erring, passionate
man arose and looked at the other in his calm, truthful
scorn, and burning words leaped to his lips.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span></p>

<p>"Clendenon, you don't know what you are talking of. You
blame me for what I cannot overcome. Do you know where I
was born? Under the burning skies of Louisiana. The hot
blood of the fiery South leaps through my veins, the burning
love of the Southern clime pours its flood-tide through my
heart, the passionate jealousy of the far South fires my soul. I
cannot help my nature. I cannot entirely control nor transform
it into a colder, calmer one. Blame me if you will, think
me unmanly if you will, but I have told you the truth. It shall
be the study of my life to bring this madness into subjection.
Till then I will not hold my wife in my arms, will not kiss her
dear lips. It is for the best. I will not frighten her from me
forever by showing her how like a madman I can be under the
influence of my master-passion."</p>

<p>Slowly, slowly the hours wore on until midnight. Mrs.
Clendenon fell into a light doze in the sick-room, but Lulu was
still watching that still form. The shaded lamps burned dimly,
the room was full of shadows, the strange silence and awe that
fill a room at an hour like this brooded solemnly over all things.</p>

<p>Poor Lulu looked at her mother. The sweet old face, framed
in its soft lace cap, was locked in such gentle repose the girl had
not the heart to awaken her. It grew so lonely she wished her
brother would return to the room.</p>

<p>Presently she bent forward and looked into Conway's face,
and laid her hand tenderly on his brow; it felt warmer and
more natural; he stirred slightly. Before she could move her
hand his white lids unclosed, the dark eyes looked at her with
the calm light of reason in their depths.</p>

<p>"Gracie, is it you?" he whispered, faintly.</p>

<p>"Not Gracie&mdash;Lulu," she answered.</p>

<p>"Not Gracie&mdash;Lulu?" he slowly murmured after her, and
wearily closed his eyes.</p>

<p>"I think he will live," said a voice above her.</p>

<p>She looked up. Her brother and the surgeon had come in so
quietly she had not heard them. She rose from her wearisome
vigil and glided softly down stairs, moved by a divine impulse
of pity for the pale watcher below.</p>

<p>"I think it is life," she said, simply.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span></p>

<p>He sprang up and looked at her, two stars dawning in the
dusk eyes, a glory shining on his darkly handsome face.</p>

<p>"Thank God!" he cried, "I am not a murderer!"</p>

<p>And strangely as he had come he was gone.</p>

<p>With the rosy dawn of the summer day consciousness returned
to Bruce Conway&mdash;a dazed, half-consciousness, though,
that only took in part of the scene, and a memory that only held
Grace Winans. He muttered of her in his distracted slumbers;
he waked and asked for her with a piteous anxiety that went to
Lulu's tender heart.</p>

<p>"Had we better send for her?" she wistfully queried of her
brother.</p>

<p>"No, indeed, little sister; it would only complicate matters.
She would not come; he does not deserve it. Poor boy! I am
sorry, but we can do nothing."</p>

<p>"Nothing, brother?"</p>

<p>"To bring her here, I mean. Try to reason with him, Lulu,
and talk him out of this feverish fancy."</p>

<p>"Grace&mdash;Gracie!" came in a whisper from the bed.</p>

<p>Lulu was by him in an instant.</p>

<p>"Will not I do as well as Grace?"</p>

<p>"No." His pallid brow contracted in a vexed frown. "Go
away; you are not Grace."</p>

<p>"No, but I am Willard's sister. Cannot you like me a little
for his sake, and not worry yourself so much?" she asked, gently
and persuasively.</p>

<p>"Cannot you get Grace to come&mdash;won't you try?" he whispered,
in a faint voice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span></p>

<p>A low tinkle of the door-bell seemed to echo his words. Half
raising his handsome head, he looked at her eagerly.</p>

<p>"That may be Grace now," he said. "Won't you go and
see?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she answered, gently, though she sighed as she went;
"I will go and see."</p>

<p>She started in astonishment when she opened the door. Outside
was a pleasant-faced Irishwoman, dressed plainly and
neatly, with a pretty babe in her arms. It was Mrs. Winans'
nurse and child.</p>

<p>Grace had learned from Miss Story where Bruce was, and
when Norah went out to take the little boy for his morning airing,
she had directed her to call and inquire of Captain Clendenon
how Mr. Conway was getting on.</p>

<p>Norah introduced herself and her business briefly and clearly,
and Lulu invited her in and gave her a seat.</p>

<p>"And this is Mrs. Winans' baby?" she said, taking the beautiful
boy from the nurse's arms and kissing his rosy face. "How
lovely he is!"</p>

<p>Little Paul smiled fearlessly back at her, and something in
the dark flash of his eyes so vividly recalled his father that she
thought suddenly of Bruce Conway waiting up stairs for her.</p>

<p>"I will bring my brother down to tell you exactly how Mr.
Conway is," she said; and turning away with the little bundle
of lace, and cambric, and laughing babyhood in her arms, she
went back to Bruce Conway's room.</p>

<p>Her brother looked surprised at the strange little visitor. She
smiled and went up to the bedside, holding triumphantly up the
tiny baby that, quite unabashed by the strange scene, jumped,
and crowed, and smiled brilliantly at Bruce.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Winans did not come, but she sent her representative,
Mr. Conway," she said, thinking it would please him to see the
pretty child. "This is her son."</p>

<p>"Her son!" Bruce Conway's eyes dwelt a moment on that
picture of rosy health and beauty, and a shudder shook him
from head to foot. "Her child! his child! Take it away from
me, Miss Clendenon. I hate it! I hate her!"</p>

<p>Lulu recoiled in terror at the sharp, angry tones and the jealous
pain and madness that gleamed in his eyes. She turned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
away surprised and frightened at the mischief she had done,
and was about to leave the room.</p>

<p>"Lulu, let me see the baby," said her brother's voice, as she
reached the door.</p>

<p>His tones wore strangely moved, and as he came across to her
she noted the faint flush that colored his high forehead. He
took it in his arms and looked long and earnestly at the little
face, finding amid its darker beauty many infantile beauties borrowed
from the fair lineaments of its mother.</p>

<p>"God bless you, little baby," he said, touching reverent lips
to the innocent brow, with a prayer in his heart for her whose
brow was so mirrored in that of her child that he flushed, then
paled, as he kissed it, thinking of hers that his lips might never
press.</p>

<p>He loved the child for its mother's sake.</p>

<p>Bruce hated it for its father's sake.</p>

<p>It was a fair exponent of the character of the two men.</p>

<p>He gave it quietly back to Lulu, but she, explaining her errand
sent him to tell Norah, with the child in his arms, while
she went back to soothe the irritated invalid.</p>

<p>"I am sorry," she began, penitently, "I would not have
brought the babe, but I thought, I fancied, that you would like
it for its mother's sake. Forgive me."</p>

<p>The moody anger in his eyes cleared at sound of her magical,
silver-sweet tones.</p>

<p>"Forgive <i>me</i>," he said, feebly. "I was a brute to speak to a
lady so&mdash;but I was not myself. You don't understand a man's
feelings in such a case, Miss Clendenon. Thank you for that
forgiving smile."</p>

<p>He caught up the little hand gently straightening his tumbled
pillows, and with feeble, pallid gallantry, touched it to his
lips. A shiver of bitter-sweet emotion thrilled the young girl
as she hastily drew it away.</p>

<p>"You must not talk any more," she said, gently, "or brother
will scold, and the surgeon, too. Brother will be back in a
minute, so be quiet. Don't let anything occupy your mind, and
try, do, to go to sleep and rest."</p>

<p>She put her finger to her lip and nodded archly at him.</p>

<p>He smiled back, and half-closing his eyes, lay looking at her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
as she took a chair at the other end of the room, and busied herself
with a bit of fancy work.</p>

<p>"How pretty she is," he thought, vaguely, and when he fell
into a fitful slumber, her fair face blent with Grace's in his
dreams, and bewildered him with its bright, enchanting beauty.</p>

<p>To Bruce Conway the months of slow and tardy convalescence
seemed like dead weights on his impatient, restless soul; to
Grace Winans, in her splendid but strangely silent home, where
but few guests were received, and which she rarely left, time
passed as it did to Mariana in the Moated Grange. But for all
that, the summer passed like a painful dream, and the "melancholy
days" had come; "time does not stop for tears."</p>

<p>Mrs. Conway had prevailed on Bruce to compromise his intention
of going abroad again by spending the winter with her
amid the gayeties of Washington&mdash;the "Paris of America."</p>

<p>How far a pretty face had influenced him in making this decision
it is impossible to say; but Mrs. Conway, in her gratitude
to the Clendenons for their kindness to her idol, had fairly worried
them into consenting to let Lulu pass the winter with her
in the gay capital city. For Lulu it may be said that no persuasion
was needed to obtain her consent, and how far her fancy
for a handsome face had influenced <i>her</i>, we will not undertake to
say either. However this may be, the Washington newspapers
duly chronicled for the benefit of fashionable society the interesting
intelligence that the elegant Mr. Bruce Conway,
the hero of the much talked of Norfolk duel, and his still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
brilliant aunt, Mrs. Conway&mdash;both so well known in Washington
circles&mdash;had taken a handsome suite of rooms at Willard's
Hotel for the winter. And the newspapers&mdash;which will flatter
any woman in society, be she fair or homely&mdash;added the information
that Mrs. Conway had one of the belles of Norfolk for her
guest&mdash;the lovely Miss C.&mdash;concluding with the stereotyped compliment
that her marvelous beauty and varied accomplishments
would create a stir in fashionable society; and thus was Lulu
Clendenon launched on the sea of social dissipation.</p>

<p>A deep flush of shame and annoyance tinged the girl's dimpled
cheeks, as leaning back in a great sleepy hollow of a chair
in their private parlor, skimming lightly over the "society
news," she came upon this paragraph about a week after their
arrival.</p>

<p>Bruce Conway, lounging idly in an opposite chair, marked
that sudden rose-flush under his half-closed lids, and wondered
thereat.</p>

<p>On her pallid cheek and forehead came a color and a light.</p>

<p>"As I have seen the rosy red flushing in the Northern night,"
he spouted, in his old non-commital fashion of quoting Tennyson
to pretty girls.</p>

<p>She glanced across at him, her color brightening, "all the
spirit deeply dawning in the dusk of hazel eyes," but she uttered
no word.</p>

<p>"Well, Brownie, what is it?" he queried, giving her the name
he often called her for her nut-brown hair and eyes.</p>

<p>"This."</p>

<p>She folded down the paragraph and tossed it across to him,
with a willful pout of her red lips, and watched with solicitude
for the sympathetic indignation she expected to read in his
eyes.</p>

<p>He finished it, and laughed.</p>

<p>"Umph! Some people wake up and find themselves famous.
Well, what is the matter with that? Is not the notice sufficiently
flattering?"</p>

<p>"It is not that!" She sprang up and began walking excitedly
up and down the floor. "I do not like it&mdash;I&mdash;it is a shame to
drag a young girl's name before the public that way. It puts a
modest girl to the blush. A 'stir in society,' indeed!" her lip<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
curling, a comical anger in her brown eyes. "I have a great
mind to go home to mamma and Brother Willie."</p>

<p>Bruce Conway opened his sleepy eyes in polite amazement at
this home-bred girl, whose pure modesty recoiled from what
was so grateful to the ears of most modern belles.</p>

<p>"Well, but you are a novelty," he laughed. "In these days
of women's rights, and shoddyism, and toadyism, and all the
rest of the isms! Why, the majority of the belles of society
would give their ears for a notice like that! That is why they
court the journalists&mdash;assiduously inviting them to receptions,
soirees, and the like. They always expect a flaming compliment.
And new arrivals are always honored by a flattering
notice. The thing is quite <i>a la mode</i>."</p>

<p>"Well, I do not like it. I think it is an abominable fashion,"
persisted the little maiden.</p>

<p>"I agree with you," said Bruce, seriously. "It is 'brushing
the delicate bloom from the grape.' But don't air such opinions
in public, Lulu, or Barnum will be wanting you for one of his
curiosities."</p>

<p>His glance turned from her and roved down the society column&mdash;then
he rose, his face a trifle paler, and crossing to the window,
read a paragraph almost directly beneath the one which
had incited the indignant protest of the little Norfolk beauty.</p>

<p>"And by the way, society will miss its most brilliant jewel
from its setting, in the absence of the youthful and lovely Hon.
Mrs. Winans, of Norfolk. Rumor reports that the fair lady is
so devoted to her infant son that, with the concurrence of the
indulgent Senator, she gladly foregoes the dissipations of fashionable
life to watch the budding and unfolding of his infantile
charms."</p>

<p>And it, this grandiloquent style society, which knew perfectly
well all about the difference between Senator Winans and his
lovely wife, was informed that he did not intend to bring her to
Washington during the ensuing session of Congress.</p>

<p>Conway ground his firm white teeth.</p>

<p>"So he dares show the world how he neglects her," crushing
the paper viciously in his hand as though it were Paul Winans
himself. "Poor Gracie&mdash;poor wronged and injured girl!" sighing
deeply. "Neither Winans nor I was worthy of her."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span></p>

<p>Lulu, who had resumed her seat, looked up wondering at the
clouded brow and unintelligibly muttered words. He smiled,
subduing his emotion by a strong effort of will.</p>

<p>"You have not told me yet what are your plans for to-day&mdash;ah!
here comes my lady aunt. Dear madam, will you kindly
designate what are your plans for to-day, and command your
humble servant?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Conway smiled her brightest smile on her idol.</p>

<p>"Let me see," glancing at her watch: "only ten o'clock.
You can be off for your morning cigar and stroll on the avenue&mdash;when
you come back we will have decided."</p>

<p>He rose, handsome, smiling, <i>debonaire</i>, but desperately ennuied,
and glad, if truth must be told, to get away. Small talk
was a bore to him just then, in his perturbed mood. He picked
up Lulu's embroidered handkerchief that she had carelessly let
fall to the floor, and presenting it with a jaunty "by-by," went
his way followed by their admiring eyes. He was his aunt's acknowledged
idol; Lulu's unconscious one.</p>

<p>Mrs. Conway plunged at once into the subject of amusements
for the day.</p>

<p>"Let us see&mdash;there is Mrs. R's reception at two&mdash;we musn't
fail them. You will see the <i>creme de la creme</i> there, my dear.
When we get away we will have a drive over to the little city of
Alexandria; at six, dinner; at eight, the opera; at twelve, you
and Bruce shall have an hour for the German at Mrs. Morton's
ball, and then&mdash;well, home again."</p>

<p>"Quite an attractive programme," smiled her companion,
from the depths of the "sleepy hollow."</p>

<p>Mrs. Conway smiled musingly, as she fixed her dark eyes on
the pattern of autumn-tinted leaves that trailed over the velvet
carpet.</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, with the indifference of one who is used to
it all, "it is last season over again; it is all very charming to
one unaccustomed to the round. Poor Gracie was here last
winter&mdash;these, by the by, were her rooms then, the handsomest
suite in the hotel&mdash;we went everywhere together. She enjoyed
it all so much."</p>

<p>A look of interest warmed the listless gaze of Lulu. The pet
curiosity of her soul was Grace Winans, heightened, perhaps,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
by an indefinable jealousy that went far back into the past,
when Grace Grey's violet-pansy eyes had been the stars of Bruce
Conway's adoration. She said, regretfully:</p>

<p>"Is it not a wonder that I have never seen Mrs. Winans?
And there is no one I would like so much to see. Is she so very
beautiful?"</p>

<p>"'Perfectly beautiful, faultily faultless,'" was Mrs. Conway's
warmly accorded praise, "and as lovely in mind as in person.
She inherits both qualities, I believe, from her mother, who was,
I have heard, the most amiable and beautiful woman in Memphis
to the day of her death."</p>

<p>"Ah! Is Mrs. Winans not a Virginian, then?"</p>

<p>"No, only by adoption. Her father was a slave-holder before
the war&mdash;one of the out and out aristocrats of Memphis. He
was a colonel in the Confederate army, and killed at the head
of his regiment during the first of the war. He was a very
noble young fellow, I believe, and devoted to his wife and little
daughter. The wife died broken-hearted at his loss, and left
this little Grace to the care of relatives, who placed her in a
boarding-school, where she remained until the close of the war
freed the slaves her father left her, and she was penniless. I
advertised about this time for a companion; she answered, and
I engaged her. She has been in Virginia ever since. She was
just sixteen when she came to me&mdash;a charming child&mdash;she is
about twenty-one now."</p>

<p>A tender throb of sympathy stirred Lulu's heart as she listened.
Brought up in the warm fold of a mother's love,
caressed, petted, beloved, all her life, she could vaguely conjecture
how sad and loveless had been the brief years of Grace
Grey's life.</p>

<p>"I regret that Bruce's unfortunate affair has, in some sort,
put an end to our intimacy," Mrs. Conway went on, pensively.
"I was fond of Grace, and had grown so used to her in her
long stay with me, that she seemed almost like one of my own
family. I would have been proud of her as my daughter. She
might have been something almost as dear but for&mdash;well, let us
call it an error of judgment on my part and my nephew's." She
paused a moment, sighed deeply, and concluded with, "I would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
like you to know her, Lulu. Your brother admired her very
much, I think."</p>

<p>"I think he did," Lulu answered, simply.</p>

<p>"Next week Congress convenes," said the older lady, brightening;
"then I shall take you quite frequently to the capitol
to hear the speeches of the eminent men. Winans will be
there, I presume. I hear he has been traveling all summer,
but he must, of course, be here in time for the session. He is
quite a brilliant speaker, and was excessively admired last
session."</p>

<p>"Has all the far-famed Louisiana eloquence and fire, I presume?"
says Lulu, curiously.</p>

<p>"Yes, although he has been many years away from there, but
he has the hot temper and unreasoning jealousy of the extreme
South, as one may see from his cruel treatment of his wife and
child."</p>

<p>"I have just seen him," said Bruce's voice at the door.</p>

<p>"Seen whom?"</p>

<p>"Winans, to be sure, the man you're talking of," sauntering in
and flinging his handsome person recliningly on the divan and
looking extremely bored and fatigued in spite of the shy smile
that dawned on Lulu's lip at his entrance.</p>

<p>"Where did you see him?" Mrs. Conway queried, in some
surprise and anxiety.</p>

<p>"Oh, tearing down the avenue on a magnificent black horse
as if he were going to destruction as fast as the steed would
carry him&mdash;that is just his reckless way though."</p>

<p>"You recognized each other?" his aunt made haste dubiously
to inquire.</p>

<p>"Oh, certainly," says Bruce, with a light smile. "I threw
away my cigar to make him a polite bow; he returned it with a
freezing salutation, but there was something in his face that
would have stirred a tender heart like Brownie's here into pity
for him, though stronger ones like mine, for instance, acknowledge
no such sentimental feelings."</p>

<p>"How did he look?" queried Brownie, unmoved by his half-jesting
allusion to her.</p>

<p>"Like a proud man who was trampling on the heart he had
torn from his bosom to save his pride; pale, cynical, melancholy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
defiant&mdash;pshaw! That sounds like a novel, doesn't it,
Lulu?"</p>

<p>"Poor Paul Winans!" she answered only; but the compassion
in her voice for him was not so great as the pained sympathy
that looked out of her speaking glance for Bruce Conway.</p>

<p>For Lulu saw with preternaturally clear vision, the struggle
that was waging in the young man's soul; saw how truth, and
honor and every principle of right were battling for one end&mdash;the
overthrow of the love that having struck down its intertwining
roots in his soul for years, was hard to be torn up. She
pitied him&mdash;and, ah! pity is so near akin to love.</p>

<p>Something of her pity he read in her expressive face, and
straightway set himself to work to dispel her gloom. Bruce
never could bear to see the face of a beauty overshadowed.</p>

<p>"Brownie, have you tried that new song I sent you yesterday?"</p>

<p>Lulu confessed she had not.</p>

<p>"Try it now, then," he answered, rising, and throwing open
the piano.</p>

<p>She rose, smiling and happy once more, and took the seat at
the piano. He leaned by her side to turn the pages, and presently
their voices rose softly together in a sweet and plaintive
love-song. But his heart was full of another, and, as he turned
the pages for Lulu with patient gallantry, he remembered how
he had turned them for another, how his voice had risen thrillingly
with hers in sweeter songs than this, mingling with her
bird-like notes as it never should "mingle again."</p>

<p>It was January, and the keen, cold sea-air swept over Norfolk,
freezing the snow as it fell, and chilling the very marrow
of the few pedestrians whom necessity compelled to be abroad
that inclement morning. The fast-falling flakes obscured everything
from view, but Mrs. Winans stood at a window of her elegant
home gazing wistfully out at the scene, though the richly
appointed room, the fragrance of rare exotic flowers that swung
in baskets from the ceiling, the twitter of two restless mockingbirds,
all invited her gaze to linger within. But the delicious
warmth, the exquisite fragrance, the sweet bird-songs, held no
charm for the fair and forlorn young wife to-day. Now and
then she moved restlessly, disarranging the fleecy shawl of soft
rose-color that was thrown about her shoulders, and turning at
last, she began to walk swiftly across the floor, wringing her
little white hands in a sort of impotent pain.</p>

<p>"I can't bear this, and I won't!" stopping suddenly, and
stamping a tiny slippered foot on the velvet carpet that scarcely
gave back the sound. "I am to stay here because <i>he</i> says so;
because he chooses to desert me. He wearies, perhaps, of his
fetters. Why cannot I go to Washington, if I choose, for a few
days anyhow? I could go up to the capitol vailed, and see <i>his</i>
face, hear his voice once more. Ah, heaven! that I should
have to steal near enough to <i>see him</i>! My darling&mdash;beloved,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
though so cruel to me&mdash;how can I bear this and live? I must,
must go&mdash;must look in for the last time in life, on your dear,
too cruelly dear face!"</p>

<p>The violet eyes brightened strangely as the words fell from
her lips whose firm curves showed a fixed resolution.</p>

<p>"Yes," she whispered to herself, firmly, "I <i>will</i> go!"</p>

<p>What was it that seemed to clutch at her heart like an icy
hand, freezing in her veins the warm blood that but a moment
before had bounded with passionate joy at thought of seeing
her husband again? What meant that chill presentiment of
evil that seemed to whisper to her soul, "You are wrong&mdash;do
not go!"</p>

<p>"I <i>will</i> go!" she said again, as if in defiance of that inward
monitor, and folding her arms across her breast, she resumed
her slow walk across the floor.</p>

<p>The pretty shawl fell from her shoulders, and lay, like a great
brilliant rose, unheeded on the floor; the long, sweeping train
of her blue cashmere morning-dress flowed over it as she
walked, the white ermine on her breast and at her throat trembling
with the agitated throbs of her heart. Her pure, pale
cheek, her eyes darkening under their black lashes, the white,
innocent brow, the mobile lips, all showed the trace of suffering
bravely borne; but now the patient spirit, tried too deeply,
rose within her in desperate rebellion.</p>

<p>For this one time she would take her own way, right or
wrong. Go to Washington she would, see her husband, herself
unseen, once more, she would; then she would go back to her
dull, wearisome life&mdash;her rebellion extended no farther than
that. But she wanted, oh, so much, to see how he looked; to
see if suffering had written its dreary line on his face as on hers;
to see him because&mdash;well&mdash;because her whole warm, womanly
heart hungered, thirsted for a sight of the dusk-proud beauty
of her husband's face.</p>

<p>The honest Irish face of Norah, entering with little Paul,
clouded as she took in the scene. She had grown wise enough
to read the signs of emotion in the face of the young lady, and
now she saw the stamp of pain too plainly written there to be
misunderstood.</p>

<p>"Pretty mamma!" lisped the toddling baby, stumbling over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
the pink shawl in his eagerness to grasp the skirt of the blue
dress in his baby fingers.</p>

<p>She stooped and lifted her idol in her arms, pressing him
closely and warmly to her aching heart.</p>

<p>"What should I do without my baby, my darling? Why, I
should die," she cried, impulsively, as she sunk among a pile of
oriental cushions and began to play with the little fellow, her
soft laugh blending with his as he caught at her long sunny
curls, his favorite playthings, and wound them like golden
strands about his fingers.</p>

<p>The shadow of her clouded life never fell upon her child.
In her darkest hours she was always ready to respond to his
mirth, to furnish new diversion for his infant mind, though
sometimes her heart quailed with a great pang of bitterness as
the laughing dark eyes, so like his father's, looked brightly up
into her face.</p>

<p>But sad as her life was, it would have been unendurable without
her baby. He was so bright, so intelligent, so full of rosy,
sturdy health and beauty. The slowly increasing baby-teeth,
the halting baby-walk, the incoherent attempts at speech, were
all sources of daily interest to Grace, who was ardently fond of
babies in general, and her own in particular. And this baby
did for Grace Winans what many another baby has done for
many another wretched wife&mdash;saved her heart from breaking.</p>

<p>"Norah," she said, looking suddenly up with a flitting blush,
"what do you say to a trip to Washington next week, after this
snow-storm is quite cleared away&mdash;do you think it would be safe
for little Paul?"</p>

<p>"Hurt him! I think not. He is so strong and healthy; but
has the Senator written for you to come on?" asked Norah,
eagerly.</p>

<p>"No"&mdash;her brow clouded, and that warm flush hung out its
signal-flag on her cheek again&mdash;"he has not. I do not
mean for him to know anything about it. I shall stay but a
day or two, only taking you and baby; then we shall return as
quietly as we went, and no one be the wiser; and now, Norah,
baby is falling asleep, take him to his nursery, and bring me
the Washington papers, if they have come in yet."</p>

<p>"They came hours ago; it is eleven o'clock, Mrs. Winans, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
you have taken no breakfast yet. Won't you have it sent up
here to you?" said the kind-hearted nurse, solicitously.</p>

<p>"Have I not taken breakfast? I believe I do not want any;
I have been thinking so intently I have lost my appetite, and
was actually forgetting that I had not breakfasted," then noting
the pained look that shaded Norah's face, "Oh, well, you may
bring me a glass of milk with the papers."</p>

<p>But Norah, after depositing her sleeping burden in his crib in
the nursery, brought with the papers a waiter holding a cup of
warm cocoa, a broiled partridge, stewed oysters, warm muffins
and fresh butter, the specified glass of milk crowning all. Depositing
the waiter on a little marble table, she wheeled up a
comfortable chair and installed Mrs. Winans therein.</p>

<p>"You are to take your breakfast first," she said, with the
authority of a privileged domestic, "then you can read the
papers."</p>

<p>She laid them on a stand by the side of her mistress and
softly withdrew to the nursery. And lifting the glass of milk
to her lips with one hand, Grace took up the Washington
<i>Chronicle</i> with the other and ran her eyes hastily over the columns,
devouring the bits of Congressional news.</p>

<p>As she read her cheek glowed, her pearly teeth showed themselves
in a smile half-pleased, half-sorrowful. Praise of her husband
could not but be dear to her, but her pride in him was
tempered by the thought that he cared not that she&mdash;his wife&mdash;should
be witness of and sharer in his triumphs.</p>

<p>And turning away from the record of his brilliant speech on
Southern affairs, she glanced indolently down the column of
society news, recognizing among the names of women who stood
high in the social scale many who had been among her most
intimate friends the preceding winter. She had been the queen
of them all then, reigning by right of her beauty and intellect
no less than by her wealth and high position&mdash;best of all, queen
of her husband's heart&mdash;and as the thought of all that she had
been "came o'er the memory of her doom," the dethroned
queen sprang from her chair and paced the floor again, burning
with passionate resentment, stirred to her soul's deepest depths
with the bitter leaven of scorn, not less a queen to-day though
despoiled of her kingdom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span></p>

<p>And thus one vassal, still loyal, found her as the servant
ushered him quite unceremoniously into the bright little parlor,
startling her for a moment as he came forward, a few wisps of
snow still clinging to his brown curls, and melting and dripping
down upon his shoulders in the pleasant warmth diffused
around.</p>

<p>She glanced at him, shrank back an instant, then came forward
with rising color and extended hand.</p>

<p>"Captain Clendenon! This is indeed a pleasant and very
welcome surprise."</p>

<p>He bowed low over the slim white hand, murmured some
inarticulate words of greeting, and stooped to replace the shawl
that still lay unheeded where she had dropped it on the floor.</p>

<p>"Allow me," he said, with grave courtesy, and folded it with
his one arm very carefully, though perhaps awkwardly, about
her shoulders.</p>

<p>Then a momentary embarrassing silence ensued, during which
he had seated himself in a chair indicated by her, and opposite
the one into which she had languidly fallen.</p>

<p>In that silence she glanced a little curiously at the face whose
dark gray eyes had not yet lifted themselves to hers. She had
not seen him in some months before, and he looked a little
altered now&mdash;somewhat thinner, a trifle more serious, but still
frank and noble, and with an indescribable respect and sympathy
in the clear, honest eyes that lifted just then and met her
glance full.</p>

<p>"I must ask your pardon for intruding on the entire seclusion
that you preserve, Mrs. Winans," he said, with the slight
pleasant smile she remembered so well. "The fact that I am
your husband's lawyer, and that I come on business, must plead
my excuse."</p>

<p>She bowed, then rallied from her surprise sufficiently to say
that an old and valued friend like Captain Clendenon needed no
excuse to make him welcome in her home.</p>

<p>A faint flush of gratification tinged his white forehead an instant,
then faded as a look of pain on the lovely face before him
showed that some indefinable dread of his mission to her filled
her mind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span></p>

<p>"I am not the bearer of any ill news," he hastened to remark.</p>

<p>"Ah! thank you&mdash;I am glad," the fading color flowing back
to her lips, "we women are so nervous at thought of ill news&mdash;and&mdash;and
I get so depressed sometimes&mdash;I suppose all women
do&mdash;that I can conjure up all sorts of terrors at that word&mdash;the
woman's bugbear&mdash;'business.'"</p>

<p>"Yes, I presume all women <i>do</i> get depressed who preserve
such inviolate seclusion as you do, Mrs. Winans," he answered,
gravely, "and that brings me to my object in coming here this
morning. I had a letter from your husband yesterday, in which
he made special mention of you in alluding to various reports
which have reached him relative to your utter retirement from
society."</p>

<p>"Well," she asked, coldly, as he paused, a little disconcerted
by her steady gaze, and by his consciousness of touching on a
delicate subject.</p>

<p>"And," he went on, "your husband seemed annoyed, or
rather fearful that your health might suffer from such unwonted
seclusion. He begged me to speak with you on the subject,
and assure you that he would rather hear that you took pleasure
in the society of your friends, and passed your time in walking,
driving, and, in short, all the usual pursuits that are so conducive
to your health and the diversion of your mind from
brooding over troubles that cannot at present be remedied."</p>

<p>A faint sarcastic curve of her red lip betrayed her contempt
before it breathed in her voice:</p>

<p>"Is that all?"</p>

<p>"Not quite," he flushed again beneath her steady gaze, and
said, abruptly, "Mrs. Winans, I trust you do not blame me for
fulfilling your husband's trust. It is not intended, either by
him or myself to wound you, and I have undertaken it, not&mdash;well,
because I thought I could express his wishes regarding
you, to you better than another."</p>

<p>"I am not thinking of blaming you," she said, gently, "not
at all. I thank you for your kindness; I do indeed. Captain
Clendenon, you should know me well enough to think better of
me than that implied. Please go on."</p>

<p>"There is but little more," he answered, more at ease. "You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
will recollect, I suppose, having signified to Senator Winans a
wish to revisit the home of your childhood?"</p>

<p>She slightly bowed her head.</p>

<p>"He merely wished me to tell you that should you still desire
it, you are at liberty to visit Memphis now, or whenever
you wish to do so, to remain as long as you please."</p>

<p>He rose at the last word, and she rose also, pale, proud, defiant,
woman-like, having the "last words."</p>

<p>"Ah, indeed! I may go to Memphis, then, if it so please
me?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Mrs. Winans;" and taking a step forward, he looked
down at the fair face that he saw for the first time shaded with
contempt and anger. "You are not angry?"</p>

<p>A mutinous quiver of the red lip answered him; just then it
seems impossible for her to speak. A great, choking lump
seems to rise into her throat, and prevent her from speech.
Her heart is in a whirl of contending emotions&mdash;joy that her
husband remembers and cares for her comfort&mdash;grief, pain, indignation
evoked by his message&mdash;he is willing she should go
far away from him, he is indifferent about seeing her, while she&mdash;she
has been so wild to see him.</p>

<p>While she stands thus, the captain says, in his grave, singularly
sweet tones:</p>

<p>"Mrs. Winans, I have known you so long, and am so much
older, and perhaps, wiser, than you&mdash;I have learned wisdom
knocking around this hard old world, you know&mdash;that you will
pardon a word of advice from an old friend, as you were kind
enough to call me just now. Try and overlook what seems to
you injustice in your husband. His course toward you seems
to him the wiser one, and he is perhaps the best judge of what
was right for him&mdash;in this lately expressed wish of his he seems
actuated solely by a desire for your comfort and happiness&mdash;he
wishes ardently that you may content yourself during the period
of his voluntarily enforced absence. Think as kindly as
you can of him. I am sure that all this tangled web of fate will
come straight and plain at last."</p>

<p>She responded to his wistful smile with another, as chill and
pale as moonlight.</p>

<p>"Thank you; and, Captain Clendenon, you may tell your correspondent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
that I shall avail myself of his gracious permission
to visit another city&mdash;not Memphis. I have no desire to visit
there at present."</p>

<p>He looked down at the sweet, flushed, mutinous face with a
yearning pity in his eyes, and a great throb of pain at his
heart&mdash;the anguish of a man who sees a woman that is dear to
him bowed beneath sufferings that he cannot alleviate.</p>

<p>All he could do was to clasp the small hand in sympathetic
farewell, and beg her earnestly to call on him if ever she needed
a friend's services.</p>

<p>"Since you will not go to Memphis," he said, relinquishing
the small hand.</p>

<p>"No, I will not go&mdash;at least, not now," she answered, supplementing
the harsh reply by a very gentle good-by.</p>

<p>When she <i>did</i> go, Paul Winans would have given all he possessed
on earth to have recalled that freely accorded consent.</p>

<p>"I like Captain Clendenon so much," she wrote, in daintiest
of Italian text, that night, within the sacred pages of her journal.
"There is something so supremely noble about him, and to-day
he looked at me so sorrowfully, so kindly, as I have fancied
a dear brother or sister might do, had I ever been blessed with
one. I used to shrink at seeing him; he brought back the first
great shock of my life so vividly, and does still, though not so
painfully as of old. It is only like touching the spot where a
pain has been now&mdash;'what deep wound ever healed without a
scar?' And I do not mind it now, though the unspoken sympathy
in his great gray eyes used to wound my proud spirit deeply.
I don't think he ever dreamed of it, though. Mrs. Conway
used to think that he liked me excessively. I don't know&mdash;I
think she was mistaken. I cannot fancy Willard Clendenon
loving any woman except with the calm, superior love of a noble
brother for a dear little sister. And he has a sister, though I
have never seen her&mdash;charmingly pretty, Norah says she is. I
believe I should like to know her, if she is at all like her brother.
But all women, as a rule, are so frivolous&mdash;or, at least, all those
whom fate has thrown in my way. At least, I should like to
have a brother like this quiet, unselfish captain&mdash;this sterling,
irreproachable character with the ring of the true metal about
it&mdash;and a sister like what I fancy his pretty sister must be. Oh,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
Paul, were you not so cruel my poor heart would not be throwing
out its bruised tendrils so wildly, seeking for some sure
support on which to lean its fainting strength. It is so hard to
stand alone&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She closed the book abruptly at a sound of baby laughter
from the nursery, and gliding into the room stood looking at
Norah's busy movements. She was giving Master Paul his
nightly bath on the rug in front of the fire. Up to his white
and dimpled shoulders, in the marble bath of perfumed water,
the little fellow was laughing and enjoying the fun to his heart's
content. It won the child-like young mother to laughter too.
She seated herself on a low ottoman near him, and watched the
dear little baby, with its graceful, exquisite limbs flashing
through the water, a rosy, perfect little Cupid, and something
like content warmed her chilled and perturbed spirit.</p>

<p>"I can never be utterly desolate while I have him," she murmured,
running her taper, jeweled fingers through the clustering
rings of his dark hair.</p>

<p>Norah, looking across at her mistress, asked, timidly, if she
were quite resolved on going to Washington next week.</p>

<p>Mrs. Winans' soft eyes fixed themselves on the bright anthracite
fire in the grate, as if an answer to the question might be
evoked from its mystic hearth. Her baby seized the opportunity
thus afforded to catch the nearest end of one of her floating
ringlets, and dip it in the bath with mischievous fingers.
She caught it from his fingers with a fitful smile, and began
wringing the water from the golden tendrils, and asking
absently:</p>

<p>"What was it you asked me, Norah?"</p>

<p>"I asked if you really intended visiting Washington next
week," explained Norah, clearly and intelligibly. She was an
educated Irishwoman, and did not affect the brogue of her
countrymen.</p>

<p>"Yes, I certainly do so intend," decisively this time, and
leaning a little forward, twisting the damp curl into a hundred
glittering little spirals, she went on: "for a few days only
though, as I believe I told you this morning."</p>

<p>"You will not take much baggage, then, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"No," smiling at the baby's antics in the water, and dodging<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
the drops he mischievously splashed in her direction, "only a
small trunk with necessary changes for baby and myself. I certainly
shall not stay more than three days at the most."</p>

<p><i>Shall not?</i> On the mystic page of our irrevocable destiny our
resolves are sometimes translated crosswise, and <i>will</i> sometimes
becomes <i>will not</i>, and <i>shall not</i> oft becomes <i>shall</i>! We, who cannot
see a moment beyond the present hour, undertake in the
face of God to say what we shall or shall not do in the unknown
future! But poor human hearts,</p>

<p>It was a crisp, cold, sunny morning toward the last of January,
and all the world&mdash;at least, all the Washington world&mdash;was
packed in the Senate galleries at the capitol, the occasion being
the speech of one of the master minds of the Senate on a very
important subject that was just then agitating the country North
and South. But we have nothing to do with this brilliant
speech. We will leave the gentlemen in the Reporters' Gallery
to report it in irreproachable short-hand. For ourselves we are
looking for friends of ours who have eddied thither with the
crowd, and are occupying seats on the east side, where they
command a good view of the Senate floor. There they are&mdash;Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
Conway in black silk, bonnet to match, gold eye-glasses,
and the yellowest and costliest of real lace shading throat and
wrists&mdash;an out-and-out aristocrat from the tip of her streaming
ostrich plume to her small kid boot. Near her sits Lulu Clendenon,
the brilliant center of many admiring eyes. The little
Norfolk beauty has become a noted belle under the chaperonage
of Mrs. Conway, and to-day she looks rarely beautiful in her
brown silk dress, with soft facings and trimmings of seal-brown
velvet, her soft brown furs, and a sash of fringed scarlet silk at
her throat, confining the soft lace frill. Her great velvet-brown
eyes hold two restless stars, her round cheeks are dashed with
fitful scarlet, all her nut-brown hair is arranged on the top of
her head in a mass of lustrous braids, and one long heavy ringlet
floats over her sloping shoulder. The daintiest little hat of
seal-brown velvet, with the scarlet wing of a bird fluttering one
side crowns the small head, whose stately poise is grace itself.
Bruce Conway, languid, handsome, elegant, in attendance on
the little beauty, is the envy of half the Washington fops.</p>

<p>They sit dutifully still and listen to the learned harangue from
the Senator on the floor below, admire his tropes, follow his
gestures, wonder how much longer he is going to continue,
until Bruce, who has come there every day that week, and
listened to "that sort of thing" till he wearies of it all, loses his
interest in the subject, and allows his appreciative glance to
wander over the galleries at the beaming faces of the "fair."</p>

<p>"Lots of pretty girls here," he whispers to Lulu.</p>

<p>"Yes," she murmurs back, then stifling a pretty yawn.
"What a long speech this is! Don't you think so?" bending
one ear to him and the other to the speaker.</p>

<p>"Awfully slow," he answers, glancing at his watch. "Oh! I
say, did I tell you, Brownie, or did you know that Winans is
expected to reply to this speech?"</p>

<p>"No. Is he?" she asks, eagerly.</p>

<p>"Yes; and the other is winding up his peroration now, I
think. Ah! there he sits down, and there is my lordly Winans
rising now&mdash;how kingly he looks!" says Bruce, in honest admiration
of the man who is his enemy.</p>

<p>Lulu settled herself for strict attention, as did every one else,
a low hum of admiration echoed through the galleries, and then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
silence fell as the musical, resonant voice of Paul Winans filled
the grand old Senate Chamber, weakening the strong points of
his opponent in the political field with clear practical reasoning,
handling his subject skillfuly and well, keen shafts of wit and
sarcasm flashing from his lips, his dark eyes burning with inspiration,
his whole frame expanding with the fiery eloquence
that carried his audience along with him on its sparkling tide.
He had never spoken so ably and brilliantly before, and low
murmured praises echoed on all sides from the audience and
the members, and pencils flew fast in the Reporters' Gallery.</p>

<p>Lulu sat still and speechless, charmed with the eloquence of
the speaker, her eyes shining, her full red lips apart. At some
argument more telling than the rest, something that appealed
forcibly to her clear mind, she turned instinctively to seek sympathy
in the eyes of Bruce Conway, only to discover, with dismay,
that he was not looking at her nor the speaker. His face
was strangely white, his eyes were looking across at the opposite
gallery at some one&mdash;a pretty girl Lulu judged from the expression
of rapt interest he wore. Silently her glance followed
his, roving over the sea of faces till it found the focus of his,
and this is what she saw:</p>

<p>Near to, and on the right of the Reporters' Gallery, a lady
leaning forward against the railing, her dark, passionately
mournful eyes following Paul Winans with deep, absorbing interest.
All the faces of fair women around her paled into insignificance
as Lulu looked at that pale, clear profile, as classically
chiseled, as "faultily faultless," as if cut in white marble by
some master-hand; the vivid line of the crimson lips, the black,
arched brows so clearly defined against the pure forehead, the
ripple of pale-gold hair that, escaping its jeweled comb at the
back, flowed in a cascade of brightness over the black velvet
dress, that fitted so closely and perfectly to the full yet delicate
figure as to reveal the perfection of gracefulness to the watcher.
A tiny mask vail of black lace that she wore had been pushed
unconsciously back over the top of her little black velvet hat,
and so she sat in her pure, melancholy loveliness before the eyes
of the girl who interpreted Bruce Conway's look aright, and
knew before she asked a word that this could be no other than
the being she had so long wished to gaze upon&mdash;the fair, forsaken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
wife, the beautiful and determined recluse&mdash;Grace
Winans.</p>

<p>She touched his arm with an effort, her heart throbbing
wildly, her breath coming in a sort of gasp.</p>

<p>"Will you tell me the earthly name of the divinity who absorbs
your flattering notice?"</p>

<p>He started violently and looked round like one waking from
a dream. Her voice in its tones was much like her brother's,
and she had used almost his very words at Ocean View when he
first saw Grace. No effort of his will could subdue his voice
into its ordinary firmness, as he answered:</p>

<p>"Oh, that is the Hon. Mrs. Paul Winans."</p>

<p>And Lulu answered, with an unconscious sigh:</p>

<p>"I could not have imagined any one so perfectly lovely."</p>

<p>"Grace here&mdash;is it possible?" commented Mrs. Conway, lifting
her eye-glass to stare across at the young wife. "Well,
really, I wonder what has happened, and why she is here, and
where she is staying? I must find out and call."</p>

<p>In which laudable desire she continued to gaze across, trying
to catch the young lady's eye; but Mrs. Winans had neither
eyes nor ears for any one but her husband. Her whole soul
was intent on him, and when the speech came to an end she remained
in the same rapt, eager position until, just as he was
resuming his seat amid the prolonged applause, one of those
strange psychological impressions that inform one of the intense
gaze of another caused him to look up, and his dark eyes,
still blazing with eloquent excitement, met the deep, impassioned
gaze of her violet orbs, swimming in unshed tears; he
sank into his seat as if shot.</p>

<p>As for her, she started up, horrified at having betrayed her
presence, and was trying to get out of the thronged gallery
when a sudden request to have the galleries cleared while the
Senate went into executive session set all the crowd on their
feet and moving toward the doors. Mingling with them and
quite unaccustomed to visiting the capitol unaccompanied,
Grace found herself suddenly alone, and quite lost in a maze of
corridors far away from the moving throng of people. Perplexed
and frightened at she knew not what, she hurried on,
only losing herself more effectually, seeing no outer door to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
vast, wandering building, and, strangely enough, meeting no
one of whom to learn the way out, until as she desperately
turned into yet another long corridor she stumbled against a
gentleman coming in the opposite direction. Looking up she
met the surprised eyes of Bruce Conway, and remembering only
that she wanted to get out of that place, that she was in trouble,
and that he had been her friend, her white detaining hand
caught nervously at his coat-sleeve.</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. Conway," she almost sobbed, "I have lost my way
and cannot get out of the capitol; will you set me right?"</p>

<p>Before a word had passed his lips, while she yet stood with
her dark, uplifted, appealing eyes burning in Conway's soul, a
quick, ringing step came along the corridor, and Paul Winans
stood beside them, towering over both in his kingly height and
beauty.</p>

<p>And the untamed devil of a jealous nature rose in his eyes and
shone out upon the two.</p>

<p>"Great God!" he breathed, in tones of concentrated passion,
"Grace Winans, are you as false as this?"</p>

<p>The small hand fell nervelessly from Conway's coat-sleeve
and transferred itself to her husband's arm, her eyes lifted
proudly, gravely to his.</p>

<p>"I am not false," she answered, in a ringing voice; "you
know that I am not, Paul."</p>

<p>"Am I to disbelieve my eyes?" he questioned, in fiery tones.
"I saw you in the gallery&mdash;here in Washington, without my
knowledge or consent&mdash;I go to seek you and place you under
proper protection, and find you&mdash;you <i>my</i> wife&mdash;clinging to this
man's arm, your eyes uplifted in such graceful adoration as
would make your fortune on the tragic stage&mdash;and yet you are
not <i>false</i>! It would seem that Mr. Conway has not suffered
enough at my hands already."</p>

<p>The latent nobility in Bruce Conway's nature passed over
the taunt unnoticed in his solicitude for the young creature
who stood trembling between them, beloved by each, rendered
so fatally unhappy by both.</p>

<p>"Senator Winans," he said, coldly, but earnestly and remarkably
for one of his wavering nature, "there is no need for this
scene. I encountered your wife in a purely accidental manner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
only this moment. She could not find her way out, and requested
me to show her the entrance. She was frightened and
alarmed, and had you not come up as you did, I should have
complied with her wish, placed her in her carriage, and left
her. I could not do less for any lady who needed my momentary
protection. This is all for which you have to upbraid
Mrs. Winans, whom, pardon me, you have injured enough already."</p>

<p>Senator Winans passed over the concluding home thrust, and
bowed coldly but disbelievingly. He turned to his wife, still
burning with resentful anger, but the words he would have
spoken faltered on his lips as he looked at her.</p>

<p>She had removed her hand from his arm, and fallen back a
pace or two from him, her slender figure thrown back, the
trailing folds of her rich black velvet robe sweeping far behind
her on the marble floor. Her small hands hung helpless at her
sides, her fair face looked stony in a fixed despair that seemed
as changeless as the expression on the marble face of the statue
that stood in a niche near by.</p>

<p>Poor child! Her heart was aching with its unmerited humiliation.
Here stood the man who had won her young heart in
earlier days, only to cast it aside as a worthless toy, a mute witness
of the same thing re-enacted by another, and that other one
who had promised to love, cherish, and protect her through all
the storms of life. To her proud, sensitive soul it was like the
bitterness of death to stand there as she stood between these
two men.</p>

<p>"Well, madam, I am waiting to hear what you have to say for
yourself," her husband said, coldly.</p>

<p>She whirled toward him, a sudden contempt burning under
her black lashes, her voice cool, clear, decisive.</p>

<p>"This: that I do not choose to stand here and bandy words
with you, Senator Winans, exposed to the comment of any chance
passer-by. Whatever more on the subject you can have to say
to me I will hear at my private parlor at Willard's Hotel this
evening between eight and nine o'clock, if you will do me the
honor to call. At present, if one of you gentlemen will take
me to my carriage, which is in waiting, I will put an end to this
scene."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span></p>

<p>She looked quite indifferently from one to the other, feeling
all her latent pride rise hotly to the surface, as neither stirred
for an instant. Then her lawful master drew her hand through
his arm, with the cold deference he might have accorded a
stranger. She bowed to Mr. Conway, and was led away and
placed in the carriage that awaited her, without a word on
either side.</p>

<p>And Bruce went back to his aunt and Lulu, whom he
had left talking with some friends in the rotunda. He said
nothing to them, however, of the scene that had just occurred.</p>

<p>But the fact of Mrs. Winans' presence at the capitol was very
well known by this time. Some of her "dear five hundred"
friends had seen her when the little mask vail had been unconsciously
thrown back in her eager excitement, and those
who had not seen her were told by those who had. Many eyes
curiously followed the hero of that long past love affair, whose
shadow still brooded so pitilessly over Grace Winans' life, as he
moved away by the side of the brown-eyed belle to whom society
reported him as <i>affianced</i>.</p>

<p>"What next?" he queried, smiling down into the slightly
thoughtful face.</p>

<p>"I don't know&mdash;that is&mdash;I believe Mrs. Conway spoke of the
Art Gallery next," she answered, listlessly.</p>

<p>"After luncheon, though. We go to the hotel first for lunch,"
interposed Mrs. Conway, briskly, who not being young, nor in
love, was blessed with a good appetite. "After that the Art
Gallery, and there is that masquerade ball, you know, to-night."</p>

<p>"As if our daily life were not masquerade enough," he thinks,
with smothered bitterness, as he attends them down the terraced
walks to the park, thence to the avenue, for they decide on
walking to the hotel, Lulu having a penchant for promenading
the avenue on sunny days like this when all the city is doing
likewise.</p>

<p>"For I like to look at people's faces," she naively explains to
the young man, "and build up little romances from the materials
culled thereby."</p>

<p>"Ah, a youthful student of human nature! Can you read
faces?" he retorts, brusquely.</p>

<p>"Sometimes, I fancy, but very imperfectly," she says, flushing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
a little under his keen gaze, as she walks on, her silken
skirts sweeping the avenue, in the perfection of grace.</p>

<p>"Read mine, then," he answers, half jestingly, half curious
as to her boasted power, as they fall a little behind the elder
lady.</p>

<p>"I cannot," she answers, "I would not attempt it."</p>

<p>"Nay," he insists, "fair seeress, read me even one expression
that has crossed my tell-tale face to-day&mdash;come, I want to test
your power."</p>

<p>"Well," she answers, half-reluctantly, "once to-day in the
gallery, there was a look on your face&mdash;flitting and momentary,
though&mdash;that reminded me of this line which I have somewhere
read:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"'Despair that spurns atonement's power.'"</p></blockquote>

<p>"Was I right?" looking away from him half-sorry that she
had said it, and fearful of wounding him.</p>

<p>And "silence gave consent."</p>

</p>


<p>Between eight and nine o'clock Grace had specified as the
hour when her husband might call&mdash;and the French clock on the
mantel of her private parlor at Willard's hotel chimed the
half-hour sharply as he was ushered in by an obsequious
waiter.</p>

<p>The room was entirely deserted&mdash;no, a child was toddling uncertainly
across the floor, jingling in its baby hand that infantile
source of delight an ivory rattler, with multitudinous silver
bells attached thereto.</p>

<p>What discordance will not a mother endure and call it music
for the baby's sake?</p>

<p>One searching glance, and Paul Winans had his child in his
arms, clasped close to his hungry, aching heart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span></p>

<p>His boy! <i>his!</i> Long months had flown away since he had
looked on the face of his child, and now he held him close, his
proud, bearded lip pressed to the fragrant lips of the babe,
his breath coming thick and fast, his jealous, passionate heart
heaving with deep emotion.</p>

<p>But the child started back, frightened at the bearded face of
the stranger, and his low cry of fear struck reproachfully to his
father's soul.</p>

<p>"A stranger to my own child," he muttered, bitterly. "Why,
my baby, my baby, do you not know your own papa?"</p>

<p>"Mamma! papa!" repeated the child, and with a sunny,
fearless smile, he stroked the noble brow that bent over him.</p>

<p>Grace had taught his baby lips to love the name of "papa,"
and now at the very sound his terror was removed, and he
nestled closer in the arms that held him as though the very
name were a synonym for everything that was sweet and
gentle.</p>

<p>The unhappy mother entering at that moment with pride and
reserve sitting regnant on her brow, reeled backward at that
sight, with a quivering lip, and pale hands clasped above her
wildly throbbing heart.</p>

<p>It was but for a moment. As he turned to the rustle of her
silken robe, with their child clasped in one strong arm, she
came forward slowly, very slowly, but standing before him at
last with bowed head and hands clasped loosely together.</p>

<p>Captain Clendenon had said of her long before, that as much
of an angel as was possible for mortal to possess was about her.
I don't know about its being so much angel&mdash;I, who know
women better than the captain did, think that the best of them
have quite sufficient of the opposite attribute about them; but,
at this moment, all of the angel within her was roused by the
sight of her husband with their child in his arms.</p>

<p>A moment before her soul had been charged with desperate
anger and rebellion&mdash;now her face wore a soft, sad tenderness,
her lifted eyes the clear glory of a suppliant angel's.</p>

<p>"Oh, my husband," she breathed, in low, intense accents,
"you have scorned all words of mine, turned away from me
with my defense unheard&mdash;let the pure love of our innocent
babe plead for its innocent mother!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span></p>

<p>It was like the low plaint for forgiveness from a wayward
child that comes sobbing home to its mother with its small
fault to confess&mdash;and she was so child-like, so very young, so
very wretched. A sharp thrill of agonized pity and self-reproach
made his firm lip quiver as he looked down at her, fiery love
and hate struggling in his soul. A wild impulse to clasp her
to his bosom&mdash;to crush against his sore heart all that pale yet
glowing beauty, for one moment rushed over him, to be sharply
dispelled by the memory of his jealous vow, and he answered
not, but gazed on her for speechless moments, marking with
eyes that had hungered weary months for a sight of her, every
separate charm that distinguished this fatally fairest of women.</p>

<p>And she was looking very lovely to-night. Her entire absence
of color, while it robbed her of one charm, bestowed another.
That glowing yet perfect pallor of impassioned melancholy&mdash;that
dark brilliance of eyes that could, but would not weep&mdash;made
her beauty more luring than before; for a sorrowful face
always appeals most directly to the heart.</p>

<p>She wore a dress he had always admired&mdash;a dinner-dress of
pale, creamy-hued silk, shading, as the lustrous folds fell together,
into pale wild-rose tints. A fragrant, half-blown tea-rose
blossomed against her whiter throat, among frills of snowy
lace, and a slender cross of pearls and diamonds depended from
a slight golden chain that swung almost to her slim, girlish
waist; a bandeau of rare pearls clasped on her brow with a diamond
star held her golden hair in place, and gave the last touch
that was wanting to make her fairly royal in her loveliness.</p>

<p>This was <i>his</i> wife! In all his jealous love and hatred, that
name thrilled his soul like a pan of triumph. All that beauty
was his, his own; but&mdash;the undying thought thrilled him like a
sword thrust&mdash;it might have been another's, had that other
asked it first.</p>

<p>That other! he had seen her clinging to his arm that day,
her magical eyes uplifted to his in deep emotion. In the anger
that rose at the remembrance, he forgot the passionate pride and
love that had shown on him from the gallery that morning&mdash;forgot
everything but that later scene; and as it rushed vividly
back to his mind, he put his hand to his face and groaned aloud.</p>

<p>And still she stood mute, moveless, with that hunted look<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
deepening on her face, as no word or sign betrayed his answer.</p>

<p>"You will not even answer me!" she moaned, at last.</p>

<p>"It needs not his love to plead your cause, Grace," he answered,
in heart-wrung accents. "While I thought that your
only fault was in deceiving me before our marriage, my own
love pleaded unceasingly for you, my every effort was directed
to the destruction of my fiery jealousy and anger toward you. I
was succeeding. God knows this is true. The message I sent
you by Captain Clendenon was the outgrowth of that milder
mood. In all probability I should soon have returned to you&mdash;glad
to call you mine, even though I knew you to have once
loved another. <i>Once!</i> My God! how little I knew of the dark
reality! how little I dreamed of your deception until I saw you
here to-day&mdash;with him!"</p>

<p>"Oh! not <i>with him</i>!" she cried, in indignant denial&mdash;"oh! not
<i>with him</i>! I had met him but that moment, and by the merest
accident. Paul, was I to blame for that?"</p>

<p>"Mamma, pretty mamma!" lisped the baby, reaching his
arms to her in vague alarm at the papa who was grieving her
so, and, with cold deference, he laid him in his mother's arms,
as he answered:</p>

<p>"Not to blame for meeting him accidentally, of course, Grace;
but you were to blame for stopping him, for clinging to him,
for looking into his eyes as you did, knowing what you did of
the feelings existing between himself and me&mdash;deeply to blame."</p>

<p>"I was frightened," she pleaded. "I did not think&mdash;it would
have happened just the same had it been a stranger, and not
Mr. Conway."</p>

<p>"Ah, no!" he sneered, beside himself with jealous passion.
"I have learned, too late, that your marriage with me was one
of ambition and pride. There was love in the look you gave
him, Grace&mdash;such love as you have never accorded me."</p>

<p>He was walking excitedly up and down the floor, never even
glancing at her. She sighed bitterly, pillowing her burning
cheek against her child, as though to gather strength before she
spoke again.</p>

<p>"You are mistaken; it was fright, alarm, foolish nervousness;
not love, God knows; anything else but that! I do not know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
how to please you, my husband. You are fearfully, causelessly
jealous&mdash;oh! what <i>did</i> you want me to do?"</p>

<p>"I did not want you to touch him; I did not want you to
speak to him or notice him. I <i>am</i> jealous, Grace," stopping
suddenly beside her, and gathering all her long fair ringlets into
his hands, and lifting one bright tendril caressingly to his lips&mdash;"so
jealous that I am almost angry with the very winds when
they dare lift this treasured glory from your shoulders."</p>

<p>She trembled so violently that she was forced to put down the
child on a cushion at her feet. As she turned, with a mute gesture,
as if to throw herself into his arms, he dropped the golden
mass from his hands and coldly turned away.</p>

<p>"I would like to know, madam," after a long pause, his voice
ringing, clear, cold, steady, from the opposite side of the room,
"why you chose to come to Washington at all&mdash;knowing it to be
against my wishes&mdash;what object could you possibly have had,
unless it were to see him?"</p>

<p>That cruel insult struck the warm fountain of tears, too oft
repressed by the proud, loving young wife. Her face dropped
in her hands, bright tears falling through her fingers; her voice
came to him mournfully earnest through its repressed sobs and
moans:</p>

<p>"Because, oh! because I wanted to see <i>you</i>, Paul, so much&mdash;oh,
so much!&mdash;that I felt I could brave your blame&mdash;dare all
your anger, but to look on your dear face once more! I hoped
you would not see me. I did not know you could be so cruel
and unjust to me, or I would have fought harder against the
temptation to come."</p>

<p>Moving toward her, he half opened his arms, then dropped
them again at his sides, with something like a moan.</p>

<p>"Oh, God, if I could only believe you!"</p>

<p>"And do you not?" she asked, slowly.</p>

<p>"I cannot. The miserable doubt that you have never loved
me, the fear that your marriage with me arose from selfish
considerations while your heart was in the keeping of one who
valued it so little then, however much he may now&mdash;Gracie,
with all these torturing doubts on my soul, I try to believe you,
and&mdash;I cannot."</p>

<p>"Once for all," she says, still patiently, "let me tell you,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
whether you credit or not, Paul, that my love for Bruce Conway
compared with my love for you was as moonlight unto
sunlight, or as water unto wine. He was the ideal of my silly,
inexperienced girlhood&mdash;nay, childhood&mdash;he <i>never</i> could have
been the choice of my maturer years. You are all I can ask for
in perfection of manliness, saving this unhappily jealous nature,
and my whole heart is yours. I did not marry you for any
selfish consideration, except that I loved you and wanted always
to be near that strong, true, noble heart, sheltered by its
warm affection. Paul, can you believe these things if I tell you
so on my very knees?"</p>

<p>He flung himself away from her with a heart-wrung sigh.</p>

<p>"God help my jealous nature, I cannot!"</p>

<p>"And you will leave me again after this&mdash;indefinitely&mdash;or forever?"
leaning her elbow on the low marble mantel, and looking
at him with a sort of wistful wonder in her tear-wet eyes.</p>

<p>"I must. My vow is recorded&mdash;I cannot help myself&mdash;it
must be fulfilled."</p>

<p>She smiled slightly, but with something in her smile that half
maddened him. The tears were quite dry on her lashes, her
cheeks were pink as rose-leaves, her bosom rose and fell more
calmly. The smile that played on her lips was not "all angel"
now. She had sued for the last time to her unjust lord.</p>

<p>"Since this is your decision," she answered, in calm tones,
that belied her tortured heart, "would it not be as well to separate
altogether? Would not your freedom be better insured
by a complete divorce from one who has so deeply deceived you
that it seems impossible to trust her again? I confess that it is
irksome to me to live upon the splendors your wealth supplies
while I am an exile and an alien from your heart. Once fairly
divorced, and we could go away&mdash;my baby and I&mdash;and never
trouble you again. I have worked for myself before; I am sure
I can do it again."</p>

<p>He glared at her speechless, her cool, quiet words stinging
him sharply, and widening the gulf between them. Before it
was a turbulent stream; now a rushing river.</p>

<p>"And then you might be Bruce Conway's wife," he says, bitterly,
at last, "and be happy ever after in his love. Is that
what you mean, fair lady?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, no, no, no! I should never marry again! I should not
want to&mdash;nor dare to! Oh, Heaven, what has love ever brought
me but agony?" with a despairing gesture of her clenched
white hand.</p>

<p>"Ta, ta!" he says, with a light, sarcastic laugh. "You should
not judge the future by the past. You 'may be happy yet,' as
one of your songs prettily expresses it. Certainly, you may
have a divorce if you wish, only,"&mdash;stooping to lift his boy in
his arms&mdash;"in that case, you know, the law will give this dear
little fellow into my sole care and keeping; though, of course,
the blissful bride of Conway will not miss the child of the man
she never loved."</p>

<p>If that last taunt struck home she did not betray it, save that
she whitened to her lips as she slowly reiterated his words.</p>

<p>"The law would take my baby from me?"</p>

<p>"Yes, of course; that is the law of the land&mdash;do you still desire
to have a divorce?"</p>

<p>"Oh, God, no! I never did, except for your sake. I felt myself
to be a burden on your unwilling hands, on your unwilling
heart, and I simply could not bear the thought. But my baby&mdash;don't
take him from me, Paul! I have suffered until I
thought I could bear no more, and that, oh! that would be
death. He is all I have to love me now."</p>

<p>She caught her child from his arms and held him strained to
her beating heart, feeling for the first time the awful agony of a
mother's dread of losing her loved one. Her husband looked at
her with no trace of his feelings written on his still face, and
merely said:</p>

<p>"Do not fear; I shall not take him from you, unless in the
event to which we have alluded. But I hope you will let me
see him while he is so near me. When do you propose to leave
Washington?"</p>

<p>"On the day after to-morrow. I only came yesterday."</p>

<p>"Ah! then I shall look for Norah, to-morrow&mdash;you have
Norah with you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, of course."</p>

<p>"Then I shall expect Norah and my baby to call on me quite
punctually, at ten to-morrow. I want to see all I can of the
little fellow while he is here."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span></p>

<p>He penciled his address on a card, and laid it on the marble
mantel. She watched him mutely as he turned toward her,
thinking gravely to herself what a great, grand, kingly nature
was marred by the jealous passion that laid waste the fair garden
of this man's soul.</p>

<p>"Hear me now, Grace, and understand that what I wrote you
in my parting note is still my wish. You will remain in our
home with our little boy; command my banker for unlimited
sums, and be as happy as you can. Do not, I beg of you, seek
to see me again."</p>

<p>"No," she answers, slowly and proudly; "the next time, <i>you
will seek me</i>!"</p>

<p>"Indeed, I hope so," he gravely answers, "so do not worry,
and think as kindly of me as you can until we meet again."</p>

<p>"Until we meet again," she murmurs, under her breath.</p>

<p>"Until we meet again," he repeats, with a lingering look,
and a deep, low bow.</p>

<p>She makes a pained, impatient gesture. He turns and goes
out, humming with a cruel lightness that breaks her heart, the
sad refrain of an old song:</p>

<p>Four o'clock striking in Mrs. Conway's parlor, and our three
friends variously disposed therein; Mrs. Conway trifling with
some light affair of fancy work, in bright-colored Berlin wool;
Bruce with the daily paper; Lulu, a trifle restless, and sitting
before the piano, striking low, wandering chords and symphonies,
turning now and then an impatient glance at the newspaper
that diverts the gentleman's attention from her. Women
are invariably jealous of newspapers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span></p>

<p>"What a nice thing it is to be interested in politics," she
says, petulantly, at last.</p>

<p>He is deeply immersed in a synopsis of the speech of Senator
Winans, having missed it the preceding day by being absorbed
in contemplation of the Senator's wife; but he looks up to
retort, lightly:</p>

<p>"What a nice thing it is to be a belle and take on airs."</p>

<p>She pouts, with a toss of her small head, then smiles.</p>

<p>"Meaning me?" she queries.</p>

<p>"Meaning you," he answers, glancing at the white fingers
that go straying over the keys, waking a low accompaniment,
to which she sings, softly:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">"Violets, roses,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sweet-scented posies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who'll buy my roses,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All scattered with dew?"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"Meaning the mammoth bouquet that came this morning
with the captain's compliments?" he interrupts her to ask, with
a glimmer of fun in his dark eye.</p>

<p>She breaks off, laughing, half-blushing, and saucily retorting:</p>

<p>"Indeed, no. Were I ever so avaricious a flower-vendor I
could not part with the gift of the gallant captain."</p>

<p>"By the way," he says, suddenly and mischievously ("by the
way" being a byword of the captain under discussion), "it
strikes me as rather droll that such a charming flirtation should
have sprung up between you and Captain Frank Fontenay&mdash;the
man who tried to help kill me, and the little fairy who helped
cure me."</p>

<p>"Ah, yes, now I think of it," with an infinitesimal shudder,
"he <i>was</i> Senator Winans' second in that affair. Well,"
saucily this, "you could not have been <i>seconded</i> by a finer gentleman."</p>

<p>He rises and saunters over to her side, out of reach of Mrs.
Conway's ears, who is near the window (exactly what Lulu
wishes him to do). Long ago he has read, like an open page,
the pure, adoring heart of this girl&mdash;no vanity in him, for it is
so palpable to all; to a certain degree he loves her, admires her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
fresh, young beauty, her sunny ways; means certainly some
day to make her his wife; and something under her surface
gayety now that reveals a wistful, unsatisfied yearning touches
him to greater tenderness than he has ever felt for her before.
As he bends to speak she turns her head, with a deepening
flush; the movement wafts to him the subtle fragrance of a
white rose worn in her brown hair, and the words she longs to
hear die unspoken on his lips. What is there in the fragrance
of a flower that can pierce one deeper than a sword-thrust with
the sweet-bitterness of memory? What kinship does it bear
to the roses that blossomed in other days, in other hands that
we have loved? Who can tell?</p>

<p>Impatiently he disengages it from its becoming brown setting
and tosses it far from him.</p>

<p>"Never wear white roses where I am, Lulu; I cannot bear
their perfume&mdash;it absolutely sickens me. I like you best in
scarlet. It suits your piquant beauty best."</p>

<p>"Did <i>she</i> wear white roses?" she queries, with inexpressible
bitterness, and reaching conclusions with a woman's quick wit.</p>

<p>"<i>She</i> wore white roses&mdash;yes," he answers, slowly, as if impelled
by some power stronger than his own volition; "and,
Lulu, she sat one evening with her lap full of white roses, and
her hands glanced among them as white as they&mdash;you have
heard the whole story before&mdash;and the only really cowardly act
of my life, the only dastardly speech of my life, was made then&mdash;oh,
Heaven! I shall never forget the eyes she lifted to my face;
white roses always stir me with remorse&mdash;always breathe the
funereal air of dead hopes."</p>

<p>"It is a sin to love her so&mdash;now," she whispered, under her
breath.</p>

<p>"I know, I know; but cannot you understand, Lu, that this
is remorse that has built its habitation over the grave of love?
Another love is rising in my heart above the wreck of my earlier
one, but my regret for what <i>I</i> caused her to suffer then&mdash;for
what I have unwittingly caused her to bear since&mdash;is, and must
ever be, unceasing."</p>

<p>"You need not grieve so deeply," she urges, trying to comfort
him. "She found consolation&mdash;she has 'learned to love
another.'"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, my loss was his gain, but still the influence of what I
did in the past throws its blighting consequence over her life;
but let us not speak of it, Lulu. There are themes more pleasant
to me&mdash;ah, if I mistake not," glancing out of a near window,
"there's the captain's faultless equipage outside&mdash;do you drive
with him this evening?"</p>

<p>"I believe I did promise him," she says, reluctantly, and the
next moment the fine-looking captain is ushered in, and Bruce
goes back to his former seat.</p>

<p>Coolly polite are the greetings between the two gentlemen.
The words that pass between them are of the briefest, while
Lulu goes for her wrappings.</p>

<p>He smiles, as standing at the window he meets her regretful
smile, and knows how much rather she had been with him than
dashing off in that handsome phaeton.</p>

<p>She carries that smile in her heart as they whirl down the
avenue, past the White House, and off by a pretty circuitous
route for the little city of Georgetown. There is a glow on her
cheek, a sweet, serious light in her eyes, a slight abstraction in
her manner, that charms her companion. He bends near her, a
sparkle in his blue eyes, a gratified smile on his lips, for he fancies
that he has called that added charm to her face.</p>

<p>She has taken his heart by storm, and before she can realize
it, he has capitulated and laid the spoils of war at her feet&mdash;namely,
the battered old heart of a forty-year-old captain in the
U. S. A., a brown-stone front on Capitol Hill, and fifty thousand
dollars.</p>

<p>She looks up in utter amaze at the fair blonde face of the
really handsome veteran, with its rippling beard and sunny
expression of good-humor, then her eyes fall, and she softly
laughs at his folly in the charmingly incredulous way with
which some women refuse an offer.</p>

<p>"My dear sir, you do me too much honor, and I would not
for the world exchange my maiden freedom for 'a name and a
ring.'"</p>

<p>The captain is not so very much disheartened. He is of a
sanguine temperament, and says he will not despair yet&mdash;in
short, means to try again at some fitting future period; and she,
leaning back, listless, half sorry for him, and a little flattered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
at his preference, wishes with all her heart that this were Bruce
Conway instead.</p>

<p>"Ah! by the way," he breaks in presently, "there is a
rumor&mdash;I beg your pardon if I offend&mdash;but is it true, as society
declares, that you are to marry Conway?"</p>

<p>Her heart gives a great muffled throb, that almost stifles her,
then the small head lifts erect and calm.</p>

<p>"It is not a fact&mdash;at least, I am not aware of it&mdash;unless,
indeed, society means to marry us willy-nilly."</p>

<p>"Society has made worse matches," he lightly rejoins.
"Conway is a prize in the market matrimonial&mdash;Miss Clendenon
certainly has no peer!"</p>

<p>She laughs. Indeed, it is one of her charming ways that she
laughs at everything that can be possibly laughed at, and since
her laugh is most musical, and her teeth twin rows of pearls,
we can excuse her&mdash;ah, how much nonsense we pardon to youth
and beauty!</p>

<p>"Ah, by the way," (this favorite formula), "talking of Conway
reminds me of my friend, Winans&mdash;in the Senate, you
know. A strange affair that of his child&mdash;don't you think so?"</p>

<p>She is busy fighting the wind, that blows the long loose
strands of her solitary brown ringlet all over her pink cheeks,
and turns half-way to him, the sunny smile utterly forsaking
her lip, answering vaguely and in some surprise:</p>

<p>"What about it? I have heard nothing."</p>

<p>"Have not?&mdash;ah!" as they turn a corner and come upon a
lovely view of the noble Potomac. "There you have a fine
view, Miss Clendenon."</p>

<p>She looks mechanically.</p>

<p>"Yes, it is grand, but&mdash;but what did you say about the
child of Senator Winans?"</p>

<p>"Ah, yes, I was going to tell you, I had not forgotten,"
he smiled. "Why, it seems that his wife was in the city,
and he called on her last evening at the hotel where she is
stopping&mdash;he told me, poor fellow, in confidence that they
parted more bitterly alienated than before. I blame him,
though, the most. I know his hot temper, you see, Miss
Lulu&mdash;and he desired her to send the child and nurse around
to his hotel this morning, that he might see as much as possible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
of the child before she returned to Norfolk, as she
designed doing to-day."</p>

<p>"Well?" she breathes eagerly.</p>

<p>She is twisting the wayward ringlet round and round one
taper finger and listening with absorbing interest as he
goes on.</p>

<p>"Well, Norah O'Neil, the nurse, took the child very punctually
to its father at ten o'clock this morning. He received them
in his private parlor that opened on a long handsome hall,
where similar parlors opened in a similar manner. And&mdash;but
this cannot be interesting to you, Miss Clendenon, since you do
not know the parties."</p>

<p>"On the contrary, I am deeply interested," she said. "Go
on if you please."</p>

<p>"Well, it seems that Winans kept the little thing so long with
him that it began to grow hungry and fretful. Winans suggested
that Norah, the nurse, you know, should go down to the
lower regions of the hotel and bring up some warm milk and
crackers for the hungry child. She went, attended by a waiter
Winans summoned for the purpose, and remained some time&mdash;ah!
Miss Clendenon, here we are on Prospect Hill with a charming
sea-view before us&mdash;and there&mdash;you see that romantic-looking
cottage not a stone's throw from us&mdash;that is the home of the
well-known novelist, Mrs. Southworth."</p>

<p>"Ah!" she said, brightly, turning a look of deep interest at
the spot. "But about the child&mdash;what happened while the
nurse was gone?"</p>

<p>"In a moment, Miss Lulu," touching whip to the prancing
iron-gray ponies and setting them off at a dashing rate. "Yes,
as I was saying, Winans played with the child that kept fretting
for Norah and the milk, and I dare say he grew tired of playing
the nurse&mdash;I should in his place, I know&mdash;and thought of taking
a comfortable smoke. He left the baby sitting on a divan,
stopped into his dressing-room, selected a good weed, lighted
it, and stepped back again."</p>

<p>"And what happened then?" Lulu inquired.</p>

<p>"Would you believe it!&mdash;the little thing that could no more
than toddle by itself&mdash;that he had left but a moment before,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
sitting on the divan, fretting for Norah and its milk&mdash;it was
gone."</p>

<p>"Gone&mdash;where?" asked Lulu, staring blankly at him.</p>

<p>"The Lord in heaven knows, Miss Clendenon. Winans ran
to the door&mdash;it had stood ajar all the time for fresh air&mdash;and
looked up and down the hall for him, in vain though. Then
the nurse came up with the milk, and they began to search together,
called up the waiters, alarmed the whole house, in fact;
and all was useless. Every room was searched, every one inquired
of, but not a trace of the child was found; he was clearly
not in the house. I happened in just then and joined in the
search. At four this evening the search had become widespread;
two detectives have scoured the city, and it seems impossible
to throw the least light on the affair. Winans is perfectly
wild about it&mdash;never saw a man suffer so."</p>

<p>"Oh, how dreadful!" breathed Lulu, "and who broke it to
<i>her</i>&mdash;the wretched mother?"</p>

<p>"Norah absolutely refused to go to her with news which she
said must certainly kill her. Winans shrunk from the task in
the same desperate horror. She does not know it yet, and he
clings to a hope of finding it before dark, and sending it back
by Norah as though nothing had happened; but I fear he will
fail. Little Paul has undoubtedly been stolen for the sake of a
ransom, no doubt, or his fine clothes; and it is probable they
will get him back, but scarcely to-day."</p>

<p>"Oh, poor unhappy Grace!" murmured Lulu, and all her
miserable, half-indefinable jealousy of the beautiful woman
melted in a hot rain of tears for the terribly bereaved young
mother.</p>

<p>The captain, greatly surprised at this feminine outburst, was
really at a loss to offer consolation. Having all a man's horror of
woman's tears, he let the sudden rain-storm have its way, and
then hazarded a remark:</p>

<p>"Why, you do not know her; I beg your pardon, do you?"</p>

<p>"No," brushing away the pearly drops with a dainty lace-bordered
handkerchief. "I have seen her, heard her trouble,
and take a very deep interest in her, and," as she dried the last
tear and looked pensively up, "I am such a baby that my tears
are ready on all occasions."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span></p>

<p>"An April day," is his oft-quoted comment, "'all smiles and
tears.'"</p>

<p>Silence falls. Captain Fontenay looks a little sad, intensely
thoughtful, evidently revolving something in his mind.</p>

<p>"You speak of having heard of Mrs. Winans' troubles," he
ventured at last. "Mrs. Conway is one of her friends, I believe?"</p>

<p>"Yes, she has known Mrs. Winans for years&mdash;loves and admires
her greatly."</p>

<p>"Perhaps then," pulling his mustache doubtfully, as they
drive slowly on, and looking anxious as to how his remark will
be received, "perhaps since Winans and the nurse both are so
reluctant to carry the news to Mrs. Winans&mdash;perhaps Mrs. Conway
would be a proper person to break it to her&mdash;that is if she
would undertake the painful task."</p>

<p>"I am sure she would do so; painful as it would be to her I
feel she would rather it were her than a stranger; she could tell
it more gently than one unaccustomed to Grace&mdash;I call her
Grace because I have gotten into the familiar habit from hearing
Mrs. Conway call her so," she said, apologetically.</p>

<p>"Then, if you think so," he makes answer, "I will call on our
return and ask her to do so, seeing Winans afterward to let him
know of her willingness to assume the unpleasant task. Then,
if he thinks best, I will call and take Mrs. Conway to her
hotel."</p>

<p>They drove back, and broke the sad news to Mrs. Conway.
Shocked, surprised, and grieved as she was, she eschewed for
once the nerves of a fashionable, and professed herself willing
and anxious to go to the bereaved young mother.</p>

<p>At seven o'clock that evening the captain called for her.</p>

<p>"No tidings of him yet," he said, "and Winans is anxious
you should go to her at once and break it with all possible tenderness,
with the assurance that he expects at any hour to find
the baby and bring it to her. Norah will come back after it is
told. Poor lady! fate has done its worst for her."</p>

<p>At the door of Grace's room let us pause, dear reader. We
have heard the moan of that aching, tortured heart so often, as
she quailed before the shafts of fate, that we dare not look on
the agony whose remembrance will haunt even the callous heart<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
of the fashionable and world-worn Mrs. Conway through all her
future years. It was the agony of Rachel weeping for her children,
and would not be comforted, because they were not.</p>

<p>At dusk of the next day Paul Winans walked impatiently up
and down the floor of his room at the Arlington House. He was
waiting for the appearance of Keene, the best detective in the
District, who had promised to meet him at six o'clock that evening,
to report progress.</p>

<p>Norah had gone back to her suffering mistress the night before,
and a vague report that had reached Winans to-day relative
to Grace's illness weighed heavily on him, as, with clasped hands
and a beating heart, he walked up and down, restlessly, striving
with his agony.</p>

<p>Remorse was busy with his soul. In this great shock that
had come upon him and his wife he lost sight of his own personal
grievance, and thought only of her, forgetting his hot rage
of two nights before, and thinking only that the breach his
senseless jealousy had made between their two hearts was now
immeasurably widened by the hand of fate. In some sort he
felt himself an innocent agent in the child's loss, and scarcely
dared hope for his wife's forgiveness.</p>

<p>"Come in," he said, pausing, as a knock echoed on the door
with military precision. "Ah! Fontenay, is it you? I expected
Keene, the detective. Come in&mdash;sit down."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span></p>

<p>Captain Fontenay did as requested, turning a silent look of
commiseration on his friend.</p>

<p>"I have just come from calling on Miss Clendenon," he observed,
"and learned that Mrs. Conway has not yet returned
from Mrs. Winans' hotel. In fact, I believe she thinks best to
remain with her until she gets better. She has, as Miss Lulu informed
me, taken rooms for herself, and Miss Clendenon, of
course, who is to rejoin her there this evening&mdash;Conway remaining
at his hotel."</p>

<p>"Ah! that is kind of Mrs. Conway," said Winans, surprisedly.
"I should not have expected so much kind feeling from one
who has always appeared to me a mere cold-hearted devotee of
fashion and pleasure."</p>

<p>"The devil is not as black as he is painted," the captain
quotes, sententiously.</p>

<p>"This Miss Clendenon seems a pleasant, or rather, a sweet
little creature," mused the Senator, aloud; "one of the sort of
women, I think&mdash;don't you?&mdash;who is worthy the devoted affection
of any one."</p>

<p>"I think so," says the captain, with enthusiasm.</p>

<p>"I was thinking"&mdash;musingly this&mdash;"that I would like her to
know my wife&mdash;like to see a cordial friendship grow up between
the two. Grace has never had an intimate female friend. She is
singularly quiet, reticent, and reserved with every one. It
would, I think, be something of a comfort to her to be brought
into familiar intercourse with Willard Clendenon's sister. She
needs the sympathy and society of one of her own sex."</p>

<p>"Let us hope they may become friends," says the captain,
heartily.</p>

<p>"But, Fontenay, this illness of Grace&mdash;I heard a rumor of it
to-day&mdash;our unfortunate affairs are by this time a town-talk.
She is not seriously out of sorts, I presume, and I am not brave
enough to go there now, and look on the desolation I have
wrought."</p>

<p>Fontenay walked across the room and laid his hand on the
other's arm, gravely and sympathizingly.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;yes," he says; "well, the truth is, Winans, I hate to
be the bearer of the tidings, but the fact is simply this: Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
Winans' excessive agitation and grief have culminated in what
the physician calls a serious attack of brain fever."</p>

<p>"Great Heaven! what have I done?"</p>

<p>The strong man reeled backward as if from a blow just as another
professional rap sounded on the door.</p>

<p>"Come in," he says, with a strong effort at self-control.</p>

<p>This time it was Keene. Slender, small, and shrewd-looking,
he fits his name, and his name fits him. He bows to both gentlemen,
leisurely taking the seat he is offered.</p>

<p>"Anything new?" he is asked.</p>

<p>"A moment, if you please. Senator, if you will be so kind as
to order up the chamber-maid who attends the ladies' parlors
on this floor, I will ask her a few questions."</p>

<p>Winans rang the bell violently.</p>

<p>"You do not suppose <i>she</i> has stolen the child?" he queries, a
little astonished.</p>

<p>"Not at all," Mr. Keene smiled cheerfully back.</p>

<p>A white-aproned waiter answered the bell just then, Winans
gave the desired order, and resumed his moody walk again,
until interrupted by the entrance of the maid he had summoned.
A rather pretty and pleasant-faced girl she was, neatly
dressed, and with a due modicum of modesty, for the color
came into her smooth, round cheek, and she looked down and
trifled with her apron-string as Mr. Keene smiled approval
at her.</p>

<p>"What is your name, my girl?"</p>

<p>"Annie Brady, sir."</p>

<p>"Ah, yes. Well, Miss Annie, you preside over the ladies'
rooms on this floor? Attend to the ladies, I mean?"</p>

<p>"Oh! yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Well, Annie, I have heard&mdash;you can tell me if it is true&mdash;did
any of the ladies you have been waiting on in this hotel leave
here yesterday for a foreign port?"</p>

<p>The pretty Irish girl reflected.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," with a small courtesy; "and indade I believe
there was wan."</p>

<p>"You believe. Are you quite <i>certain</i>?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, I am quite certain. It were the poor English lady
whose room was opposite this one&mdash;number 20, sir."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span></p>

<p>She half-opened the door and indicated number 20 with her
finger.</p>

<p>"Just across the hall."</p>

<p>"The <i>poor</i> English lady; and why do you call her poor?"
asked the detective, curiously, while the two gentlemen listened
in silence, and the girl herself edged nearer the door in surprise
and bewilderment commingled. "Was she in bad circumstances?"</p>

<p>"Why, no, sir, not that way; she seemed quite comfortable
so far as money went. It were her mind, sir," said the girl,
tapping her forehead significantly. "She seemed not quite
right here, sir."</p>

<p>"And what sort of a lady was she, and what was her name?"</p>

<p>"Her name? It was Mrs. Moreland, sir, and she looked
about thirty year old&mdash;a pretty little blue-eyed lady, quite
broken down with trouble and grief. She came on here a few
days ago from New York, and was going home to her friends in
London."</p>

<p>"Ah! and was she alone? Did she talk with you much, and
tell you the cause of her trouble?"</p>

<p>"She did talk to me sometimes. She seemed lonely and
unsettled-like, and I thought it did her good to talk to some
wan of her trials. A sore heart, ye know, sir, is all the betther
for telling its griefs over to a sympathizing heart," said Annie,
apologetically.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Keene, a little impatiently, "but you have not
told us what her trouble was."</p>

<p>"To be sure," answered Annie, good-humoredly. "She had
come over some two years since from London with her husband
to seek a better fortune, and just when they were so snugly settled
down in a dear little home in Brooklyn, and beginning to
do well in the world, and wan little baby-bird come to make
sunshine in the home, the husband and baby sickened and died,
wan after the other, sir, and the poor heart-broken widdy is just
going back to her friends almost crazy with the grief of it all,"
concluded Annie, quite breathless with her long speech.</p>

<p>A sparkle of blue lightning flashed in Keene's eyes.</p>

<p>"She had lost a child, you said?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, a pretty boy, scarce a year old. She showed me a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
photograph of them all&mdash;five little ones she had lost, he the last
of them all&mdash;black-eyed, curly-headed little beauties they were&mdash;like
their poor father, she said."</p>

<p>"And she was inconsolable at the loss of the baby?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; she fretted for it all the long days, sir&mdash;not quite
right in her head, she was not, I know, but," said Annie, wiping
away a glittering tear from her pink cheek, "it were pitiful like
to see her a tossing on the sofa, and moaning, and like as not
laughing wildly as she talked of baby Earle, as she called him."</p>

<p>"Seemed insane, you think?" asked Keene, in his quick,
short manner.</p>

<p>"Not like that," answered Annie, with mild wonder at the
gentleman's pertinacious curiosity, "but a little out of her
mind&mdash;you've heard of people being melancholy mad, sir."</p>

<p>"Yes, oh, yes," said Keene, "and so you said good-by
to this interesting little widow yesterday at about between
eleven and twelve o'clock, and she left here and took the steamer
for Liverpool?"</p>

<p>"She did go away at that time, sir, but I told her good-by
earlier as my duties called me to another part of the building.
She told nobody good-by. Indeed, all the waiters in the house&mdash;she
always had a kind word for them, ye see&mdash;they all wondered
they did not see her go out, and so missed saying good-by
to her."</p>

<p>"But her baggage, Annie? How did her baggage go
down?"</p>

<p>"Oh! her passage was taken, and her baggage sent to the
steamer, yesterday."</p>

<p>"Yes; thank you, Miss Annie, and I believe that is all I want
to ask you this evening."</p>

<p>Senator Winans supplemented Keene's thanks with a banknote,
and Annie went bowing and smiling back to the regions
whence she came.</p>

<p>The three men looked at each other, Keene breaking the
ominous silence that had fallen:</p>

<p>"This is what I came to tell you, Senator Winans. Mrs.
Moreland is on the ocean with your little boy. I have already
telegraphed to Liverpool to have her stopped when she lands
there. I have found that a woman answering her description<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
left on the steamer yesterday with a child answering the description
of yours; with the cunning of insanity that poor creature
probably saw the child at the moment of leaving, and kidnapped
it with the thought that it was her own."</p>

<p>He turned away, inured as he was to sorrow, from the white
anguish of the father's face.</p>

<p>"It is very probable you will get him back; don't give up all
as lost," he said, cheerfully.</p>

<p>"I will not," the stern energy of the man asserting itself.
"We will follow them on the next steamer, and track every
inch of ground till we find him. Every dollar I own shall be
expended if necessary. But, oh, Heaven! I cannot&mdash;his
mother&mdash;she is ill, wretched&mdash;perhaps death-stricken. I dare
not leave here."</p>

<p>"I don't know that it is necessary to follow them," Keene
said, doubtfully. "If they get him in Liverpool, he can be
sent home in the captain's care. You will not care, I suppose,
to punish her. She is probably half insane, and under a natural
hallucination that it was her own, and abducted it."</p>

<p>"No, poor creature! she has already suffered enough," said
Winans, pityingly.</p>

<p>"Ah, by the way, Winans," here interposed the captain,
"why not call and see your wife to-night, and learn if her illness
is too serious to admit of your leaving; she may be better,
and you at liberty to go. It seems the best thing under the circumstances,
in my humble judgment, that you should pursue
this woman as speedily as is possible."</p>

<p>"Perhaps so. Then, Mr. Keene, I suppose we can do nothing
more till to-morrow. If you will call on me at an early hour in
the morning we will discuss the best steps to be taken in the
matter."</p>

<p>And there being no more to say on the subject, the detective
bowed himself out, leaving the two friends alone together.</p>

<p>"Fontenay, I am afraid to go to her. She would spurn me
from her presence; I deserve it."</p>

<p>He strode across the room, and began stirring the coal fire,
shaking down the ashes, and tearing open its burning heart,
just as wounded love and bitter pain and yearning were sweeping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
the ashes of pride and jealousy from his, and showing him
the living fire that burned undimmed below.</p>

<p>"You can but try," said the gallant captain. "'Faint heart
never won fair lady.'"</p>

<p>And Winans resolved to "try."</p>

<p>Sitting at her window watching the radiant day hiding its
blushes on the breast of night, Lulu Clendenon's heart was full
of a strange, aching pain. She had, as Captain Fontenay had
told Winans, removed to the hotel where Mrs. Conway had taken
rooms, to remain until Mrs. Winans recovered from her attack of
impending brain fever.</p>

<p>As yet she had not seen Mrs. Winans, no one being permitted
to enter the sick-room excepting those who were in close attendance
on the patient; and, truth to tell, Lulu was lonely.
She missed Bruce Conway. For many weeks now the twilight
hour had been the pleasantest of the day to her, for it had been
passed in his company. Now as she sat at the window, cuddled
up in a great easy-chair, her cheek pressed down in the hollow
of her little white hand, her wistful brown eyes watching the
fairy hues of sunset, Lulu was waking to a realization of her own
heart.</p>

<p>The little sister that Captain Clendenon had wanted to keep a
child forever was a child no longer. Love&mdash;the old, old story,
old as the world, and yet new and sweet as the blushing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
flowers of to-day's blossoming&mdash;had opened for her the portals
of a broader existence, and Lulu was learning the strength and
depth of her woman's heart first by its intense aching.</p>

<p>According to the verdict of the world, it is a woman's shame
to love unsought; and yet I think that that is scarcely love
which waits to be given leave to love. Flowers blossom of their
own sweet will, and often as not their sweetest perfume rises under
the heedless feet that trample them down. It is much so with
the human heart. It gives love, not where it is asked always,
but often where it is uncared for and unknown; and the cold
steel of disappointment is but to such love as the knife that digs
round the roots of our flowers&mdash;it makes the fibers strike deeper
in the soil of the heart.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Successful love may sate itself away,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The wretched are the faithful."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Lulu wished idly that she were floating in ether on the top of
that gold-tinged cloud that rose in the far west, wave on wave,
over masses of violet, rose, and crimson; or that she might have
laid her hot cheek against that white drift that looked like a
chilly bank of snow, and cooled the fever that sent its warm
flushes over her face.</p>

<p>The pretty lip trembled a little, and Lulu felt as if she wanted
to go home, like a tired and weary child, to her mother.</p>

<p>Mrs. Conway's light footsteps, as she entered softly, startled
her from her painful reverie. She roused up into a more dignified
posture, and inquired touching the state of the young
patient.</p>

<p>"She has been delirious to-day, but is now for the time being
quite rational, though still and silent. I want to take you to see
her, my dear. You will have to help nurse her (we cannot leave
her solely to the care of that nurse and the doctor&mdash;it would be
cruel), and it is better to have her get acquainted with you now,
and accustomed to seeing you about her room. You can come
now, if you please, dear. I have spoken to her of you, and she
will be prepared to see you."</p>

<p>Lulu rose from her easy-chair, shook out her tumbled skirts,
trying to shake off a portion of her heart's heaviness at the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
time, and smoothing her dark braids a little, followed her
friend.</p>

<p>But her heart rose to her throat as they crossed the threshold
of the sick-room, and stood in the presence of a woman who had
always been such an object of interest to her.</p>

<p>The fading winter sunshine glimmered into the apartment
and shone on Norah, where she sat, grave and anxious-looking,
at the side of the low French bed, whose sweeping canopy of
lace thrown back over the top revealed the form of Grace
Winans lying under the silken coverlet, like some rare picture,
her cheeks flushed scarlet with fever, the white lids drooping
over her brilliant eyes, her arms thrown back over her head,
her small hands twisted in the bright drift of golden hair that
swept back over the embroidered pillow.</p>

<p>"Dear Grace," Mrs. Conway said, softly, "this is my young
friend, Lulu, Mrs. Winans, Miss Clendenon."</p>

<p>Slowly the sweeping lashes lifted, and the melancholy gaze
dwelt on Lulu's face, but the lips that opened to speak only
trembled and shut again in that set, firm line with which proud
women keep back a sob. One little hand came down from over
her head, and was softly laid in Lulu's own. As it lay there,
warm, feverish, fluttering like a wounded bird, the young girl's
heart swelled with a throb of passionate sympathy.</p>

<p>She bent impulsively and pressed her cool, dewy lips on the
fevered brow of the other, while she registered a vow in her
unselfish soul, that she would stand between Grace Winans and
every sorrow that effort or sacrifice of hers could avert.</p>

<p>How potent is the spell of sympathy! The light pressure of
those soft lips touched a chord in Grace's tortured heart that
never in after years ceased to vibrate. Her husband had spoken
truly in saying that she had no intimate woman-friend, but it
was scarcely her fault. Her nature was a singularly pure and
elevated one; the majority of the women she knew had few feelings
in common with her, and she was too much superior to
them not to be an object of envy rather than a congenial friend
to most. She had found a kindred spirit at last in the sister of
Willard Clendenon; and if the shifting current of fate had
ordered her life otherwise than what it was&mdash;had she married<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
Willard Clendenon, maimed, comparatively poor, unskilled in
the current coin of worldly compliment though he was, she
would have found her soul-mate. But these strange mistakes
lie scattered all along the path of life, and it is true that matches,
if made in heaven, sometimes get woefully mismatched coming
down.</p>

<p>"Her fever is getting higher," Mrs. Conway said, as she anxiously
fingered the blue-veined wrist.</p>

<p>It rose higher and higher; delirium set in, and in restless
visions the young mother babbled of her lost child; she was
seeking him&mdash;seeking him everywhere, through the wide,
thronged avenues of Washington, the long corridors of the capitol,
the dull, narrow streets of Norfolk, by the moonlit shores
of Ocean View; and the red light of a meteor in the sky was
blinding her so that she could not see; and when it faded she
was in darkness&mdash;and now burning reproaches scorched the
sweet lips with their fiery breath, and Paul Winans' name was
whispered, but with inexpressible bitterness. The impression
on her mind, strengthened by his words at their last interview,
was that he had intentionally secreted her baby to punish her
in some sort for what seemed to him faults in her. He had
struck a blow at her heart where it was most vulnerable; she
had told him it would be her death, and he had wanted her to
die; and this dismal refrain haunted her fevered slumbers
through long hours. In vain Norah cooled the burning head
with linen strips, holding masses of powdered ice; the white
arms tossed restlessly, the lips still babbled incoherent grief
and anger; the physician came, watched her for an hour, went
through the formula of prescribing, and shaking his head and
promising to see her in the morning, went his way; and the
hours went on&mdash;it was ten o'clock, and quieter slumbers seemed
to fall upon the worn-out patient; she talked less incoherently,
tossed and moaned less often.</p>

<p>"A gentleman to see Mrs. Conway," was announced by the
subdued voice of a servant at the door.</p>

<p>Supposing that it was her nephew, she glided softly out, returning
in ten minutes, to find Grace feebly tossing again and
staring with wide-open eyes at every object in the dimly lighted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
room. She bent over her and tried to fix her wavering attention.</p>

<p>"My dear, will you see your husband? Senator Winans desires
an interview with you."</p>

<p>Something in the name seemed to fix and hold her wandering
thoughts. She half-lifted herself, resting on her elbow and
sweeping her hand across her brow.</p>

<p>"My husband&mdash;did you say that?"</p>

<p>"Yes; listen, dear. He has come to see you, and is waiting
in the parlor. May I bring him in? Will you see him?"</p>

<p>A flash of hope in the fever-bright violet eyes, a hopeful ring
in the trembling voice:</p>

<p>"The baby&mdash;he has brought the baby?"</p>

<p>"No, not yet; he hopes to soon," taking the small hands and
softly caressing them with hers, "indeed, you are mistaken,
Gracie, in thinking, dear child, that he is deceiving you in this
matter. He is in great distress, longs to tell you so, and to try
to comfort you; say that you will see him."</p>

<p>"No, not I; you do not know him&mdash;he is so cruel. Oh, my
poor heart!" clasping her hands across her heaving breast, "He
has come to triumph in my anguish, to laugh at the wreck he
has made of my life."</p>

<p>"Not so, Gracie, dear little one, he has come to sympathize
with you&mdash;won't you let him come?"</p>

<p>"No, no, never!" rising straight up and shaking herself free
of Mrs. Conway's detaining hand, the delirium clouding her
brain again. "Oh, never till he comes to me with our baby in
his arms will I look upon his face again. Tell him this, and say
that if he entered that door I would most surely spring from
that window rather than look on his face with its smile of triumph
at my suffering."</p>

<p>She fell back, exhausted and quite delirious now, and Mrs.
Conway turned with a heavy heart to carry the ill tidings to the
man who waited in the next room. She was spared that pain.
The clear, bell-like voice, sharpened by anger and scorn that
was strange to that gentle spirit, had penetrated the next room,
and he knew his doom and felt it to be just, as he stood in the
middle of the floor, his hands clasped behind him, his head
bowed on his breast, a perfect picture of humiliation and despair.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span></p>

<p>"I have heard," he said, with a ghastly smile, as her fingers
touched his arm.</p>

<p>"My poor boy!" she said.</p>

<p>"It is just," he said, in a whisper of intense pain. "God
knows I merit worse at her hands, but, all the same, it goes hard
with me&mdash;the worse because, as I told you just now, I leave for
Europe to-morrow in quest of our child. Oh! Mrs. Conway,
take care of her while I am gone. Don't&mdash;don't let her die!"</p>

<p>"She shall not die," said Lulu's soft, low tones, as she glided
into the room and up to his side. "I will&mdash;we all will&mdash;do
everything to keep her for you until you come back to make her
happiness your chief care in life hereafter. She must not, will
not, die!"</p>

<p>He looked up, caught her hand, and touched it gratefully to
his lips.</p>

<p>"God bless you for those words, Miss Clendenon! You always
come with renewed life and promises of hope. Oh! watch over
her well, I entreat you; and, oh! teach her, if you can, to
think less harshly of me. May God forgive me for my folly
and wickedness to her, and give me a chance to retrieve the
past by the future."</p>

<p>The two ladies looked at each other, deeply moved.</p>

<p>"I am coming back at the very earliest possible day after I
recover my child," he went on; "but never till then. I have
heard my doom from her own lips." Then he stopped, too
deeply pained for words, and with only a heart-wrung "good-by,"
was gone.</p>

<p>"The next time <i>you will seek me</i>," she had said, at their last
fatal interview.</p>

<p>There are many thoughtless words spoken that afterward
seem like prophecies.</p>

<p>Mrs. Conway and Lulu went back to the room where they
were doomed to watch for many long weeks yet to come over
the sick-bed where life and death were waging fierce warfare
over a life-weary, reckless victim. But the "balance so fearfully
and darkly hung" that a touch may turn the scale toward
"that bourne whence no traveler returns," wavered, and dropped
its pale burden back into the arms of those who loved her; and,
shadowy, wasted, and hopeless, Grace Winans took up the cross<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
of her life again, with all the sunshine gone out of it, the only
comfort left to her bruised heart that "comfort scorned of devils"&mdash;that
comfort that is "sorrow's crown"&mdash;"remembering happier
things."</p>

<p>It is the latter part of the month of February, and Norfolk is
waking up from its winter torpor. Our friends who wintered in
Washington are all at home again. Mrs. Conway and her well-beloved
nephew are located once more at Ocean View. Mrs. Winans,
only just recovered from her severe and lengthy illness, is
once more established in her handsome residence in Cumberland
street, and has prevailed on Miss Clendenon to spend the
first few weeks after their return with her&mdash;Mrs. Clendenon,
though lonely without her, willingly giving up those weeks of
her daughter's treasured society to the fair woman of whom both
son and daughter speak in terms of such unqualified praise.</p>

<p>They are very fond of each other&mdash;Grace and Lulu&mdash;and, indeed,
the fair mistress of that grand home feels as if life will
be a blank indeed when Lulu, too, leaves her, for her pleasant
company helps to dispel the aching sense of waiting and suspense
that broods drearily over her own heart.</p>

<p>Senator Winans has not returned to the United States&mdash;indeed,
seems in no haste to return&mdash;for he has resigned his seat
in Congress, and writes that he will never return until accompanied
by the child so strangely lost.</p>

<p>At present the fate of that little child is wrapped in impenetrable
mystery. The detectives in Liverpool who were watching
for the arrival of the steamer there, were eluded by the cunning
of his poor, half-insane abductor, and not a trace of her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
afterward could be found, though the story was widely circulated
in the prominent papers, munificent rewards offered for
his restoration to his father, and the best detectives employed
to hunt the woman down. In vain.</p>

<p>Whether the little Paul yet lived was a matter of doubt to
many who considered the subject carefully, and remembered
how irresponsible, how poorly fitted to take care of the tenderly
nurtured babe, was the poor, grief-stricken, demented
creature. But Winans remained abroad, resolved that he would
never give up the search nor return home until success crowned
his efforts. And with him, to make a resolve was generally to
keep it.</p>

<p>As for Grace, the first sharp agony of her grief being past, a
sort of apathy settled upon her, a quietude that appeared to infold
her so closely it seemed as if joy or pain could never touch
her more. Very still and quiet, though sweet, and gently observant
of the cares of others, she glided through the elegant
rooms of her strangely quiet and solitary home, and books and
music, and long, lonely drives, shared only by Lulu, formed
the only objects of her daily occupation. Health returned to
her so slowly that life seemed slipping from her grasp by
gradual declining, and the fair cheek, never very rosy, wore the
settled shadow of an inward strife, the girlish lip a quiet resolution
that moved the gazer to wonder.</p>

<p>And for Lulu, also, a slight paleness has usurped the place
of the brilliant roses she carried to Washington. The starry
brown eyes hold a grave thoughtfulness new to their soft
depths, and sometimes, when suddenly spoken to, the girl
starts, as if her thoughts had strayed hundreds of miles away,
though the truth of the matter is they never strayed further
than Ocean View, where the handsome object of their thoughts
dawdled life away, "killing time" and thought as best he
might, and seldom coming into Norfolk&mdash;"recruiting after a
fatiguing season," he was wont to say, when rallied on the subject
by his numerous friends in the city, and had Lulu been at
her mother's, he would very possibly have called occasionally
to see her, but while she staid with Grace she was debarred the
pleasure of seeing him, for Bruce never expected to cross the
threshold of the house that called Mrs. Winans its mistress, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
where Lulu sat one bright, sunny morning, toward the last of
the month of February. As is often the case, February had
borrowed a windy day from March, and the "homeless winds"
shrieked around the corners, and moaned dismally in the trees
that were just putting out the safest and greenest of velvet buds,
and Lulu, sitting alone in the cozy morning parlor, idly turning
the pages of a new volume, started up in surprise and
pleasure as a servant ushered "dear brother Willie" quite unexpectedly
into the room.</p>

<p>"So glad to see you," she said, brightly, putting both hands
in his one, and rising on tiptoe for a kiss.</p>

<p>He stooped and gave her a dozen before he accepted the chair
she placed for him beside her own.</p>

<p>"Mother is well? I haven't seen her these two days," she
queries, anxiously.</p>

<p>"Mother is well&mdash;yes, and sent her love."</p>

<p>"Now," she chattered, laying aside her book, and concentrating
all her attention on him, "give me all the news."</p>

<p>"Well, Lulu, all the news I have is soon told. I am come to
bid you good-by. Winans has been urging me so earnestly in
his letters to join him abroad in his search for the little Paul,
that I have not the heart to refuse, if I wished, which I do not,
and I start to-night. There is no use putting it off, and I do
not need to. The only thing I regret is that this will curtail
your stay with Mrs. Winans, as mother cannot spare us both at
once, and will want to have you with her to console her anxieties
while 'with a smile at her doleful face, her Willie's on the
dark blue sea.' Still, dear little sister, you can spend much of
your time with Mrs. Winans, which I hope you will do."</p>

<p>"I certainly will do so," she gravely promises.</p>

<p>"It is solely for her sake that I go," he concluded. "Otherwise
I do not care for the trip, and it rather encroaches on my
business at this time. But if I can help lift the cloud from her
life, no effort of mine shall be wanting. <i>Noblesse oblige</i>, you
know, little sister."</p>

<p>She glanced up into the soft, serious, gray eyes, that met her
gaze so kindly with a smothered sigh.</p>

</div></div>

<p>"My darling," he bent and looked into the face that lay
against his shoulder, "you are not well&mdash;you do not look like
my bright, happy bird. What is it&mdash;what has troubled you?"</p>

<p>"Nothing; indeed it is nothing. I have the least bit of a
headache, but it is wearing off in the joy of seeing you," she
answered, smiling a little, and then, woman-like, touched by a
sympathizing word, breaking into tears and sobbing against his
shoulder.</p>

<p>He put his arm around her, inexpressibly shocked and
pained.</p>

<p>"Something <i>has</i> troubled you, and I know it. Tell me, Lulu,
or I cannot be content to cross the ocean leaving you with some
untold grief in your happy young heart. Come, you do not
have any secrets from brother Willie."</p>

<p>"No, no, it is nothing, dear brother, but I am so nervous of
late&mdash;have learned to be a fashionable lady, you know," smiling
faintly to allay his anxiety, "and I am so shocked to think you
are going away&mdash;so far, and so <i>soon</i>&mdash;how long do you mean to
stay?"</p>

<p>"I cannot tell. I shall write to you often, anyhow, so that
you and mother shall not miss me so much. I shall throw all
my powers into this undertaking. And, Lulu, I think&mdash;that is&mdash;I
should like to see <i>her</i> and say good-by&mdash;if you think she
would see any one?"</p>

<p>"She would see you, certainly; she is very fond of you; talks
often of you. You can go down into the conservatory; she was
there a little while since. I know she is there still. After you
tell her good-by, you will come back to me&mdash;will you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, dear," he answered, as he rose and left her, passing on
through the continuation of the elegant suite of rooms leading
out to the door of the conservatory and glancing in for her he
sought.</p>

<p>She was there. He caught his breath with a pang as he saw
the slender figure standing under a slim young palm tree, looking
like a sculptured image of thought with her downcast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
eyes and gravely quiet lips. A furred, white morning robe of
fine French merino, girded at the waist by silken white cords
and tassels, fell softly about her form and trailed its sweeping
length on the marble floor. There were faint blue shadows
around the glorious eyes, though they may have been but the
shadow of the sweeping black lashes&mdash;there was a glow but no
color on the pure, fragile cheek, and a dumb suggestion of quiet
martyrdom in the droop of the hands that loosely clasped each
other, as</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Stiller than chiseled marble standing there,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">A daughter of the gods, divinely tall,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And most divinely fair,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>the eyes of Captain Clendenon dwell on her for a moment with
a mist before their sight, and then&mdash;but then she lifted the
sweeping lids of those rare pansy-vailed eyes, and looked up
at him.</p>

<p>The ghost of a smile touched her lips as she gave him her
hand.</p>

<p>"It seems a long time since I saw you," she said, "though it
really is not two months."</p>

<p>"Sometimes," he answered, gravely, "so much suffering can
be crowded into two months that it may well seem two centuries."</p>

<p>"Ah! yes." She set her lips suddenly in the straight line
with which she was wont to keep back a sob. After a moment,
"Have you seen Lulu?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I have seen her," going over patiently, and at more
length, the information he had just given his sister, talking this
time brightly and cheerfully. "I feel almost assured he will be
found; he must be&mdash;'there is no such word as fail,' you know,
in the 'lexicon of youth,'&mdash;and I think you are giving up too
easily. You will undermine your health already weakened by
your severe illness. Why, you have the appearance of one who
has given up all hope."</p>

<p>"And I have," she calmly made answer.</p>

<p>"That is simply suicidal," he said, trying to rouse her into
hope with all the strength of his strong, true nature.</p>

<p>"You are so kind, Captain Clendenon," she flashed a blinding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
ray of gratitude from her dusk eyes upon him, "so kind to
go and look for him&mdash;my baby&mdash;believe me, I never, never can
forget it, though I feel that all search will be in vain&mdash;still, still,
it is so kind, so noble in you to do all this, and I know you are
doing it for me," laying her small hand mechanically on his
coat-sleeve in a childish fashion she had, and keeping the grateful
eyes still on his face.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Winans," he answered, quite gravely, "I would go to
the ends of the earth to serve you&mdash;any man who knows your
unmerited sufferings, and appreciates you as well as I do, could
not do less, I think."</p>

<p>"Thank you," she murmured, with the faintest quiver in the
music of her voice.</p>

<p>"And now," he spoke less gravely, and more brightly, "I
think I must be saying good-by. Is there anything I can do
for you on the other side of the Atlantic&mdash;any commission for
Parisian finery&mdash;any message for your husband?"</p>

<p>"Nothing&mdash;thanks," she answered, decisively.</p>

<p>He sighed, but did not urge the matter.</p>

<p>"You are not going to send me to Europe without one
flower, and so rich in floral blessings?" his glance roving over
the booming wilderness of beauty and fragrance all around
her.</p>

<p>"No, indeed, but you are not going yet. You will certainly
stay to luncheon, will you not?"</p>

<p>"I cannot&mdash;thanks!"</p>

<p>"You shall have all the flowers you want. What are your
favorites? Pray help yourself to all you fancy, and welcome,"
she urged, earnestly.</p>

<p>He glanced around. Everything rare, and sweet, and bright
he could think of, glowed lavishly around him, but the only
white rose that had blown that day she had quite mechanically
broken and placed on her breast.</p>

<p>"I only want one flower. I like white roses best," he answers.</p>

<p>She turned her head, bending forward to see if any were
there, and one of her long, fair curls swept across and tangled
itself in a thorny bush beside her. She caught it impatiently
away, leaving a tangle of broken gold strands on the thorny<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
stem. Before she turned back to him he had broken off the
spray and hid it in his breast.</p>

<p>"There is not a rose," lifting regretful eyes to his face, "excepting
this one I wear. I carelessly broke it, but it is still
fresh. You are welcome to that, if you will have it," she said,
sweetly.</p>

<p>"If you please."</p>

<p>She disengaged it, and put it in his hand. He retained hers a
moment.</p>

<p>"Thanks, and&mdash;good-by."</p>

<p>"Good-by," her voice said, regretfully, then added: "Oh!
Captain Clendenon, find him for me, if you can! Oh, try your
best!"</p>

<p>"I pledge you my word I will," he answered, "but promise
me that you will have faith in my endeavor; that you will live
in hope."</p>

<p>"Oh! I cannot, I cannot! I feel that I can never hope
again!" she cried, but with a brightening glance.</p>

<p>"But you will," he answered, cheerily. "Health, and hope,
and love will all come back to you in time. 'Hope springs
eternal in the human breast.' God bless you, and good-by."</p>

<p>Their hands met a moment in a strong, friendly clasp; her
violet orbs dusk and dewy with feeling; her voice scarce audible
as it quivered:</p>

<p>"Good-by!"</p>

<p>"Lulu, I have come to take you for a drive," said Grace
Winans, as she glided lightly into Miss Clendenon's sanctum,
looking fair and fresh, and smiling, in faultless summer costume
of frilled and fluted white muslin, and the daintiest of
gray kid driving-gloves, for it is six months since Captain Clendenon
went to Europe, and the last days of August are raining
their burning sunshine on the sea-girt city of Norfolk.</p>

<p>But Lulu's room, cool, fresh, inviting, a very bower of innocent
maidenhood&mdash;offers an exquisite relief from the burning
heat and general parched look of the world outside. A cool,
white India matting covers the floor; the chairs are light graceful
affairs of willow-work; the windows are shaded with curtains
of pale green silk and lace, swaying softly in the faint
breeze that stirs the trees outside. A few rare paintings adorn
the creamy-hued walls&mdash;pictures of cool woodland dells and
streams, with meek-eyed cows standing knee-deep in meadow
grass; a charmingly romantic sketch of the Chesapeake Bay,
and over the white, dainty-covered lounge, where Lulu is reclining
at ease, a picture of a cross, to which a slender form,
with a vail of sweeping hair, clings with dark, uplifted eyes
that breathe the spirit of the inscription beneath: "Helpless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
to thy cross I cling." A vase of fragrant and beautifully
arranged flowers adorns the marble center-table where the
poems of Tennyson, Hemans, Owen Meredith, and all the
authors, peculiarly the favorites of young ladies, are ranged in
bindings of green and gold. Lulu, herself, lying idly with
white arms clasped over her head, her face like a rose, her
dainty white morning-dress loosely flowing, "a single stream of
all her soft brown hair poured on one side," looked as if Rose,
the "Gardener's Daughter" had stepped down out of Tennyson
and laid herself down to rest.</p>

<p>"To drive&mdash;where?" she asked, as she rose to a sitting posture,
and "wound her looser hair in braid."</p>

<p>"To Ocean View, to call on Mrs. Conway. My neglect of
her since her great kindness to me in my illness is really unpardonable,
so we will drive down this morning, make a long,
informal call, stay to luncheon, and drive back in the cool of
the afternoon."</p>

<p>"Hum! is not nine miles a long distance to drive this warm
day?" asks Lulu, rising and flitting into her dressing-room, the
door of which stands open beyond.</p>

<p>"What! Through the cool leafy arches of the woods, with
the birds singing, the bees humming, the flowers wasting their
perfume for our sole benefit, the spirit of summer abroad in the
air&mdash;it will be exquisite!" Mrs. Winans answers gayly, as she
floats up and down the room, and, pausing before a mirror, settles
her broad straw hat a little more jauntily on her waving
ringlets.</p>

<p>"Sit down, won't you?" Lulu calls, from the dressing-room,
where she is attiring herself in fresh white robes similar to those
of Grace.</p>

<p>"I thank you, no," she is answered back. "I am fidgety.
I am restless&mdash;not in the mood for keeping quiet. I prefer to
walk about."</p>

<p>"Ah! Hysterical, I presume&mdash;is that it?" questions Lulu's
rosy lips at the door, glancing at her with gently solicitous
eyes.</p>

<p>"I dare say," not pausing in her restless walk, and Lulu,
looking closer under the light mask of gayety, reads with a sigh
traces of unrest in the fair, proud face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span></p>

<p>It is a peculiarity of Grace's constitution or temperament that
she can never keep still under the pressure of excitement or
trouble. She is always in a quiver, and even when sitting down
she is always rocking or tapping her foot, or perhaps it is only
in the convulsive pressure of her pearly teeth on her red lips
that she betrays inward unrest. I cannot give any psychological
nor physical reason for this. I only know that it is so, and
Lulu had found out this characteristic of Grace long ago.</p>

<p>"Darling," she says, coming into the room, swinging her
broad straw hat by its blue ribbons. "Darling, what is it that
troubles you?&mdash;anything new?"</p>

<p>"Anything new?" Mrs. Winans laughs, provokingly.
"Lulu, dearest, is there anything new under the sun?"</p>

<p>"I am certain the sun never shone on anything before as rare
as yourself," Lulu answers, with winning affection, lifting the
small, half-gloved hand to her tender lips.</p>

<p>Mrs. Winans pulls it away, and dashes it across eyes that look
suspiciously misty and dark.</p>

<p>"Don't, Lulu, you silly child! You are always making
me cry."</p>

<p>"And I wish I could," she answers. "I am tired of this surface
gayety, my liege lady. Oh, I am going to talk plainly!
You don't mean it&mdash;I know how you suffer, Grace, darling,
bravely as you repress it, and I know, too, that you would feel
better if you let it all blow over in a great passionate storm&mdash;rain!
But you won't. You have been living the last few
months in a whirl of gayety and pretended pleasure, and damming
up the fountain of feeling, till now it is breaking over all
your frail barriers of pride and scorn, and you will not give it
way, and it is bearing you on its current&mdash;where, oh! dearest,
where?"</p>

<p>"Hush!" came in a stifled moan, from behind the hands that
hid the girlish wife's convulsed face. "You shall not talk so&mdash;I
cannot bear it!"</p>

<p>"But I must, love," and Lulu's arm stole around the convulsed
form that still held itself proudly erect, as if disdaining
human help and sympathy. "I must, and you will forgive
poor Lulu, for it is her duty, and I must be less your devoted
friend than I am if I did not speak. Oh, you know you are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
not taking the right course to procure oblivion of your sad and
grievous troubles! It does not make you happy to whirl
through the thoughtless rounds of society amusements and
pleasures; it does not make you happy nor contented to dazzle
men's eyes and hearts with your inaccessible beauty, when seas
are rolling between you and the only man in whose eyes you
care to seem fair. Darling, I know when you go back to your
silent home your heart sinks heavier by the contrast; I know
that when you lay this lovely head upon its pillow you recall,
with agony, the time when your baby's cheek was pillowed
there against your own&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, Heaven!" shuddered the listener, "be silent, Lulu.
You will drive me mad. I cannot, cannot bear the least reference
to my child! Only just now, as I drove up Main street
in my little phaeton, taking a silly sort of triumph to myself
at the sensation created by my pretty face and cream-white
ponies, I met the funeral of a little child on its way to the
cemetery&mdash;the casket was covered with lilies and roses&mdash;and,
oh, Lulu, I thought of my own little one, and its probable fate!
and, oh, I wished my heart would break! Why, why does
not God let me die!" and, shivering with repressed agony, the
young wife suffered Lulu to hold her in her close-clasped arms,
while she wept and moaned on her breast.</p>

<p>And Lulu, wise in her young experience, let the saving tears
flow on, until Mrs. Winans lifted her head and said, mournfully;</p>

<p>"Oh, Lulu, you should not reproach me for trying to fill up
in some way the great blank in my life as best I can! I dare
not brood alone over my vacant heart and wretched doom, for
I should go mad. I must seek diversion, oblivion!&mdash;what would
you have me do?"</p>

<p>Lulu's brown eyes lifted to the picture that hung over the
lounge.</p>

<p>"Gracie," she said impressively, "is there no other way to
fill up your vacant heart and life than by utter abandonment to
the pleasures of the social world?"</p>

<p>The listener's eyes followed hers.</p>

<p>"'Simply to Thy cross I cling,'" she repeated listlessly.</p>

<p>"If you must have a salve for your wounded heart," Lulu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
went on, as she toyed with the bright curls that lay against her
shoulder still, "there is nothing on earth that so fills up vacant
heart and life as the cross of Christ the Crucified; Gracie, do
you ever pray?"</p>

<p>"I am too wretched," she answered, hopelessly.</p>

<p>"Too wretched! Oh, Gracie, dear friend, do you forget how
in the darkest hours our Lord spent in the Garden of Gethsemane
that, <i>being in an agony, He prayed more earnestly</i>? It is
in hours of the deepest suffering that we should pray most.
When we feel that earth offers no consolation, where can we
look but to heaven? And the blessing of God <i>must</i> follow such
prayers, since Christ himself has set us the example," continued
the young mentor, earnestly.</p>

<p>"No blessings ever follow my prayers," answered the mourner,
with her eyes fixed sadly, through a mist of tears, on the figure
that clung "helpless" to the cross, "even when I pray, which
I do&mdash;sometimes."</p>

<p>"You do not pray in the right spirit, then," said her friend,
gently but firmly. "You do not expect a blessing to follow
your prayers, and we are only healed by faith, not by the simple
act of prayer, but by the faith that breathes in it. If you asked
a blessing nightly, it would follow prayer, be sure. Remember
His promise, 'Ask and it shall be given you, seek and ye shall
find.'"</p>

<p>"I know, I know," answered Grace, mournfully; "but
heaven and earth alike seem to have no mercy on me. Come,
Lulu, my little ponies are impatient waiting so long," and pausing
a moment to bathe her tear-stained face in a basin of perfumed
water, she floated down the stairs, followed by the sweet
little preacher.</p>

<p>"Now, then," with a forced laugh, as they disposed the elegant
blue silk carriage-robe over their white dresses to keep out
the summer dust, and dashed off in the exquisite little phaeton
that was the envy of all Norfolk; "now, then, we are off like
the wind for Ocean View."</p>

<p>She was a skillful driver, and the beautiful, spirited little
ponies knew no law but her will. They flew like the wind, as
she had said; but as they rode on out of the narrow streets of
Norfolk, and into the cool, shady forest road, the sunshine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
glinting down through interstices of the trees, the leafy boughs
bending till they swept against the brims of their broad straw
hats&mdash;in the midst of all her idle and incessant chatter, she
heard one low sentence ringing in her ears, and an involuntary
prayer was rising in her heart: "Lord, teach me to feel that
simply to Thy cross I cling." She had been too proud almost
to humble herself even before the throne of God; she had felt
that God himself was unjust to her, and willful and wretched,
she had gone on her darkened way, asking no pity from God
nor man. To-day, the kind words of Lulu had stirred a chord
in her thoughtful heart that vibrated painfully as the question
forced itself on her mind: "Have I been unjust to and neglectful
of my God?" In a mind so pure and clearly balanced as
was hers, the seeds of evil could not take very deep root, and
the word spoken "in season" by the gentle Lulu was beginning
to bear fruit already, though Lulu dreamed not of it, as she
kept time with the stream of light and careless words her companion
unceasingly kept up.</p>

<p>"Let me drive," she said, at last, noting the unwonted rose-tint
that colored the fair cheek, and thinking it was the effect of
fatigue; "you have been driving nearly an hour, and it will be
another hour before we see Ocean View," and taking the reins
with gentle force, drove on; while the other, relieving her fair
hands of their damp driving-gloves, folded them across her lap,
and laying back her head, gave herself up to mournful retrospection,
watching the blue heavens smiling over their heads,
the play of the sunshine on the leaves and flowers as they flashed
past, and the transient glimpses of the sea now and then glimmering
through openings in the woods. Lulu's gaze dwelt
pityingly on the fair face that looked so child-like as it lay back
against the silken cushioning of the phaeton, the long black
lashes shading the flushed cheek, the golden locks, moist with
the warmth of the day, clustering in short, spiral rings all about
the pearl-fair forehead, whose blue veins were so distinctly outlined
that Lulu could see how they throbbed with the intensity
of her thoughts. There was so much fire and spirit, combined
with sweetness in that face; its exquisite chiseling, its full yet
delicate lips, its round, dimpled chin, the small, sensitive nostril,
the perfection of dainty coloring and expression, that Lulu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
could well understand how this beauty, joined to so sweet a soul,
could hold men willing captives, and at thought of her brother,
Lulu sighed deeply, and to shake off the depression that was
creeping over her, she said, gayly:</p>

<p>"A penny for your thoughts, lady fair."</p>

<p>The black lashes fluttered upward, and the pansy eyes met
Lulu's own with such impotent anguish in their soft depths that
the girl started.</p>

<p>"Darling, what can you possibly be thinking of?"</p>

<p>"Of nothing that need alarm you, my dearest," answered
Grace, summoning a smile to her lips as she said, "and here we
are at last at Ocean View."</p>

<p>"And there is John to take the horses," jumping lightly out,
and shaking her tumbled skirts. "Is Mrs. Conway at home,
John?"</p>

<p>"Ya'as'm, ole miss is at home," answered John, with a grin
of delight, as the fairy idol of the Conway retainers sprang
lightly out, and stood looking listlessly about her, nodding
graciously to John as she followed Lulu's example by shaking
out her innumerable white frills and embroideries, and leading
the way to the house.</p>

<p>"Clar to gracious!" John said, looking open-mouthed after
them, "if she don't grow mo' angelical every day of her life!
Shouldn't wonder if she took wings any day and flew away to
heben. T'other's pretty enough for anything, but <i>she</i>&mdash;oh! <i>she's</i>
a fitter mate for de <i>President</i>!"</p>

<p>With which compliment he led away the ponies for food and
water.</p>

<p>Mrs. Conway was charmed at the arrival of her two favorites.</p>

<p>"Just thinking of you both," she said, in her graceful way.
"Talk of angels and you'll see their wings."</p>

<p>The young ladies pleasantly returned the compliment as they
refreshed themselves with the iced wine and sponge cake she
had ordered for them immediately after their long and tiresome
drive.</p>

<p>"And, indeed, Grace," she said, with some concern, "you do
not look as well as you should be doing by this time&mdash;really
seem harassed and worn. I am afraid you are too gay. I hear
so frequently of your appearance in social gatherings and society<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
in general, that I hope you are not overtaxing your
strength."</p>

<p>"I think not," Mrs. Winans answered, with her grave, sweet
dignity. "My constitution is superb, you know."</p>

<p>"I should say it was," Mrs. Conway said, "after all it survived
in Washington. Still you are not looking over strong
now. Your drive in the warm sun has wearied you. Won't you
go up to your old room and lie down to rest?"</p>

<p>"No, thank you; I am feeling very well;" and Lulu, seeing
the rapid flutter of Grace's fan, knew she was getting excited
and nervous, and interposed with some trifling remark that diverted
the attention of their amiable hostess, who remembered
then to ask when Captain Clendenon had written, and how he
was progressing in his mission abroad.</p>

<p>"He writes hopefully," Lulu answered, checking a sigh; "has
nothing definite, but still keeps on with the search, which he
thinks must at last be crowned with success."</p>

<p>"Let us hope so," Mrs. Conway said, fervently.</p>

<p>Presently our old friend, Bruce, saunters in, handsome, perfumed,
elegant as ever. He bows low to Mrs. Winans, offers a
light congratulation on her improving health, and shakes hands
with Lulu, who is blushing "celestial rosy red," for she has not
seen him for a month before, and her fluttering pulses move
unsteadily, her whole frame quivers with subdued ecstasy. Oh!
love, conquerer of all hearts, whether high or lowly, what a
passionate, blissful pain thou art!</p>

<p>"And you had the energy to drive out here this sweltering
day?" in subdued surprise he queries.</p>

<p>"Yes, giving Mrs. Winans the credit of planning the trip&mdash;her
energy is untiring in creating pleasurable surprises for my
benefit."</p>

<p>Grace turns aside from her chatter with her hostess to
acknowledge the compliment with a passing, fond smile on her
favorite.</p>

<p>"If I remember rightly," Mr. Conway bows slightly toward
her, "Mrs. Winans has always had a quiet fund of energy in
her composition that is a reproach to many who are stronger
physically, but, alas! weaker in mental gifts. I am, unfortunately,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
Miss Lulu, one of those unstable ones who shall not
excel in anything."</p>

<p>Mrs. Winans never glances that way. She holds her small
head high, her underlying pride never more noticeable than
now as she goes on talking with Mrs. Conway, languidly fanning
herself the while.</p>

<p>Is memory busy at her heart? We think not, or if it is she
would not go back to those happy, idly dreaming hours this
spot recalls could they bestow all the happiness they promised
then, and denied her. So often in our maturer experience we
see the wisdom of God in withholding gifts we craved, whose
attainment could but disappoint expectation and anticipation.</p>

<p>Bruce Conway would make Lulu, with her loving capacity of
twisting love's garlands over wanting capabilities, a very happy
wife&mdash;he never could have quite filled up the illimitable depths
of Grace's heart, nor crowned her life with the fullness of
content.</p>

<p>"Will you go to see our flowers?" he asks, bending to Lulu
with one of his rarely sweet smiles. "You favor my aunt so
seldom in this way that I must needs do the honors in as great
perfection as is possible to me&mdash;one never expects any great
quota of perfection from my indolence, you know."</p>

<p>She smiles as she dons again the broad straw hat that, by
Mrs. Conway's request, she has laid aside, and rises to go.</p>

<p>He rises, too&mdash;oh, how peerless in her eyes, in his suit of cool
white linen, and his graceful indolence.</p>

<p>"I am going to rifle your flower-garden of its sweets, Mrs.
Conway," she says, lightly, as she follows him out on the broad
piazza, down the steps, and into that exquisite garden that lay
budding and glowing in the burning August sunshine.</p>

<p>"It has been almost a month since I saw you," Conway says,
drawing the small hand of Lulu within his arm as they saunter
down a shady path where the crape myrtle boughs meet over
their heads, showering pink blossoms in prodigal sweetness beneath
their feet.</p>

<p>No answer. She is looking ahead at a little bird hopping timidly
about the path, and only turns to him when he goes on pathetically:</p>

<p>"I have missed you so much."</p>

<p>"You know where I lived," she answers, dryly.</p>

<p>An amused smile outlines itself around the corners of his
handsome mouth.</p>

<p>"So you think it is solely my own fault that I have missed
you&mdash;have not seen you. Well, perhaps it is&mdash;yet&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yet what?"</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing&mdash;it does not matter."</p>

<p>"No, I suppose not," she responds, a little scornfully.
"Nothing seems to matter much to you, Mr. Conway. I believe
you have found the fabled Lotos. It would suit you, and such
as you,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"In the hollow Lotos land to live and lie reclined<br /></span>
<span class="i1">On the hills like gods together, careless of mankind."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"Whew! since when has my little Brownie learned to be sarcastic?"
he queries, in genuine astonishment, trying to look into
her face, but it is turned away from him, and she is idly stripping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
the thorns from the stem of a rose she has just broken.
Ah! if she could only as easily eradicate the thorns that rankle
in her gentle heart!</p>

<p>"Why don't you talk to me?" he says, pettishly.</p>

<p>"And have I not been talking?" turning an innocent, unconscious
face toward him, a piquant smile on her lips.</p>

<p>"I know, but without taking any interest," he says, in an injured
tone. "Don't you care to talk? Are you weary of me?"</p>

<p>"Weary of you!" she laughs. "Ah! that gives me a pretext
to quote poetry to you," and she repeats, with a very faint
tremor in her voice, the delicious lines of Mrs. Osgood:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Weary of you! I should weary as soon<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Of a fountain playing its low lute tune,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">With its mellow contralto lapsing in<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Like a message of love through this worldly din."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>He looks down into the faintly flushed face with a light, triumphant
smile she does not see. He knows as well, and better
than herself, how much she means the poetry that she has repeated
in that light, jesting tone.</p>

<p>"Thank you," he answers only. "I wish I could think you
meant it."</p>

<p>She stoops suddenly and breaks off a half-dozen great purplish
velvet pansies from a bed on the side of the patch, and puts
them into his hands.</p>

<p>"'There's pansies&mdash;that's for thoughts,'" she says, gayly.
"Think what you will."</p>

<p>"May I think that you love me?" he queries, audaciously, as
only Bruce Conway can do.</p>

<p>"I have said think what you will," she answers, growing suddenly
crimson. "But why are you throwing my pansies away?"</p>

<p>A faint flush crimsons his fair forehead, too. Their eyes look
at each other as he answers:</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I do not like pansies; they are too sad. Sometimes
when I stroll down this path with my morning cigar, Lu, they
look up at me bathed in glittering dew, and&mdash;I am not romantic,
child, but they always remind me of blue eyes swimming in
tears."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span></p>

<p>"They always remind me of the velvet darkness of Grace Winans'
eyes," she says, meditatively.</p>

<p>"'There's <i>rue</i>!'" he says, and is suddenly silent. The little,
irresistible feminine shaft has struck home.</p>

<p>He looks down at the flickering sunshine lying in spots on the
graveled path, and reflects on the acute perceptions of woman&mdash;this
little woman&mdash;in particular. She sees his pain, and is
sorry.</p>

<p>"I wonder"&mdash;stirring up a little drift of pink blossoms on
the path with the tip of her small slippered foot&mdash;"I wonder if
all our life-path is to be flower-strewn!"</p>

<p>A light flashes into his handsome dark eyes as he clasps in his
the small hand lying within his arm.</p>

<p>"Lulu dearest," he murmurs, "if you will promise to walk
hand in hand with me through life, your path shall be strewn
with all the flowers love's sunshine can warm into life."</p>

<p>A shiver thrills her from head to foot; the blue heavens
darken above her head; the warm and fragrant air that rushes
down the myrtle avenue sickens her almost to fainting. Passionate
bliss is always closely allied to passionate pain.</p>

<p>"'To be, or not to be!'" he questions softly, bending over
the drooping form, though he feels very sure in his heart what
the answer will be.</p>

<p>She is silent, leaning more heavily on his arm, her face growing
white and mournful.</p>

<p>"Dear, am I to take silence for consent?" he persists, as
though talking to a petulant child who is going to yield, he
knows. "I asked you is it to be or not to be?"</p>

<p>"<i>Not.</i>"</p>

<p>She outdoes his usual laconics in this specimen of brevity. It
is fully a minute before he recovers from his astonishment
enough to laugh:</p>

<p>"Don't jest with me, Lulu, I am in earnest."</p>

<p>"So am I."</p>

<p>For answer he lifts her face and scrutinizes it closely. The
soft gaze meets his&mdash;half-happy, half-grieved&mdash;like a doubtful
child's.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span></p>

<p>"You are not in earnest, Lulu. You do love me&mdash;you will be
my wife?"</p>

<p>"I cannot."</p>

<p>He stops still under a tall myrtle and puts his arm around
her slim, girlish waist.</p>

<p>"Brownie, willful, teasing little fairy that you are&mdash;you cannot,
you will not deny that you love me&mdash;can you, honestly,
now?"</p>

<p>"I have not denied it&mdash;have I?" her gaze falling before his.</p>

<p>"Not in so many words, perhaps; but you refuse to be my
wife&mdash;if you loved me, how could you?"</p>

<p>"If I loved you I would still refuse."</p>

<p>"Brownie, <i>why</i>?"</p>

<p>"Because&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That is a woman's reason. Give me a better one."</p>

<p>"How can I, a woman, give you a better one?" she answers,
evasively, tilting the brim of her hat a little further over her
face. She does not want him to see the white and red flushes
hotly coming and going.</p>

<p>"Because a better one is due me," he persists, his earnestness
strengthened by her refusal. "Surely, a man, when he lays his
heart, and hand, and fortune at a lady's feet, deserves a better
reason for his refusal than '<i>because</i>.'"</p>

<p>Her cheek dimples archly a moment, but she brightens as she
says, almost inaudibly:</p>

<p>"Well, then, it is because you do not love me."</p>

<p>"Lulu, silly child, why should I ask you to be my wife
then? I do love you&mdash;as love goes nowadays&mdash;fondly and
truly."</p>

<p>"Ah! that is it," she cries, bitterly, "as love goes nowadays&mdash;and
I do not want such love&mdash;my heart, where it loves, resigns
its whole ardent being, and it will not take less in return."</p>

<p>"And have I offered you less?"&mdash;reproachfully this.</p>

<p>She nods in silence.</p>

<p>"Lulu, dear, unreasonable child that you are&mdash;why do you
think that I do not love you? Be candid with me and let us
understand one another. I will not be offended at anything you
say to me."</p>

<p>"Nothing?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span></p>

<p>"Nothing! If you can show just cause why and wherefore
such a thing as my not loving you can be, I surely cannot be
offended."</p>

<p>"I know you love me a little," she returns, trying hard to
speak lightly and calmly, "but I also know, dear Bruce, that
your heart, it may be unconsciously to yourself, still retains too
much of its old feeling for one I need not name, for you to love
me as I should like to be loved. Understand that I am not
blaming you for this, but you know in your heart, Bruce, that
were she free, and would she listen to your suit, you would not
look twice at poor me."</p>

<p>Another home-thrust! He stands fire like a soldier, rallies,
and meets her with another shot.</p>

<p>"This from you, Lulu! I did not think it in you to twit me
with loving another man's wife!"</p>

<p>"I did not mean it that way," she answers, flushed and imploringly.
"I meant&mdash;only meant to show you, Bruce, that I
could not&mdash;oh! that I cared too much for you to be happy with
you unless your love was strong and deep as mine."</p>

<p>"I did not think you could be so jealous and exacting, child."</p>

<p>"I am not jealous nor exacting. I am only true to my woman's
nature," she answers, sweetly and firmly.</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" he answers, brusquely, "let all that pass&mdash;I do
love you, Brownie, not as I loved her, I own it. But you are so
sweet and lovable that it will be easy for you to fill up my heart,
to the exclusion of all other past love. Try it and see, dear.
Promise me that you will give yourself to me."</p>

<p>"I cannot."</p>

<p>"Is that final?"</p>

<p>"Final!" she gasped, as white as her dress, and leaning unwillingly
against his shoulder.</p>

<p>"Why, Brownie, child, dearest, look up&mdash;heavens! she is
fainting," cried Bruce, and taking her in his arms, he ran into a
little pavilion near by, and laying her down on the low, rustic
bench within, opened the gold-stoppered bottle of salts that
swung by a golden chain to her belt, and applied it to her
nostrils.</p>

<p>She struggled up to a sitting posture and drew a long breath,
while tears rolled over her cheeks. Both lily white hands were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
uplifted to prevent another application of the pungent salts.</p>

<p>"Don't please," she said, "you are taking away all the breath
I have left."</p>

<p>"You deserve some such punishment for your cruelty to me,"
he retorts, in a very good humor with himself and her, for he
feels he has done his duty in his second love affair, and if she
will not marry him, why that is her own affair, and he cheerfully
swallows his chagrin, and also a spice of genuine regret as
he smiles down at her.</p>

<p>"I am going back, if you please." She steps out of the pavilion
while speaking, and he attends her. As they walk silently
on he gathers a flower here and there, the rarest that blow in
the garden, and putting them together they grow into a graceful
bouquet before they reach the house. Then he presents it
with the kindest of smiles and quite ignoring the unkind cut she
has given his vanity.</p>

<p>She takes it, thanks him, and notes with quick eyes that no
roses, no white ones at least, nor pansies are there&mdash;those flowers
are sacred to memory, or, perchance, remorse.</p>

<p>"We may be friends at least?" he queries, trying to look into
the eyes that meet his unwillingly. And "always, I hope," she
answers, as they reach the piazza steps.</p>

<p>Mrs. Winans is at the piano singing for her hostess. A dumb
agony settles down on Lulu's racked heart as the rich, sweetly
trained voice floats out to them as they ascend the steps, blending
its music with the deep melancholy notes of old ocean in
the plaintive words of an old song that is a favorite of Mrs.
Conway's:</p>

<p>Mrs. Winans sat in her dressing-room before the mirror in
the softest of easy-chairs, the daintiest of dressing-gowns, under
the skillful hands of Norah, whom she had retained as her personal
attendant.</p>

<p>It was a chilly night in November, but a soft warmth pervaded
the rooms, which were heated by Latrobe stoves in the
basement of the house, and the light, and fragrance, and beauty
within seemed even more delightful by contrast with the cold
winds that whistled sharply and sullenly without. A look of
sadness was noticeable on Norah's rosy face as with gentle
touches she brushed out the long curls of Grace's hair that
crinkled and waved in spite of all effort to straighten it.</p>

<p>"Norah," Mrs. Winans had said, a moment before, "it is the
fifteenth day of November&mdash;do you recollect? Little Paul&mdash;dear
little baby&mdash;is two years old to-night."</p>

<p>"And sure did I not recollect?" answered Norah, brushing
away a quick-starting tear; "but did not speak of it to you
hoping it had escaped your own memory."</p>

<p>"As if I could forget," murmured Grace, looking down, and
beginning to slip the diamond ring that blazed on her taper
finger nervously off and on; "as if I could forget."</p>

<p>"'Tis so strange he can't be found," mused Norah, keeping
time to her words with the brush that she was plying on that
lovely hair, "and such a great reward offered by his father for
his restoration&mdash;forty thousand dollars&mdash;why that's a fortune
itself. Mrs. Winans, have you heard nothing of the matter
lately?"</p>

<p>"Miss Clendenon received a letter from her brother yesterday&mdash;she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
came around to tell me this morning&mdash;in which he stated
there was positively not the slightest cue yet. The supposition
is that&mdash;oh, Norah, think of it!&mdash;is that my little boy is <i>dead</i>.
Captain Clendenon is coming home by Christmas&mdash;he has been
in Europe ever since February, now, and even he, hopeful as he
was, has given up the search in vain!"</p>

<p>"And your husband, ma'am? Has he also given up the
search? Is he, too, coming home?" asked Norah, cautiously.</p>

<p>"He has put the whole affair in the hands of skillful detectives
to be kept up six months longer; then if unsuccessful to be
abandoned as hopeless. Captain Clendenon has the management
of his business affairs, and will take charge of this as of
the others. Senator Winans himself, Norah, has gone over to
Paris&mdash;to France."</p>

<p>"To France?" Norah echoes in surprise, "why there is a war
there&mdash;the French are fighting the Dutch."</p>

<p>"Yes, there is a war there," comes the low reply, "my husband
is by birth a Louisianian, Norah, and partly, I believe, of
French extraction&mdash;his whole sympathies are with that nation.
He has joined the French army and is gone to fight the Germans&mdash;ah!
there goes my ring&mdash;pick it up, Norah. It has
rolled away under the sofa."</p>

<p>Norah obeys and in silence replaces the ring on the little
hand that in spite of the warmth pervading the room is cold
and icy as she takes it in hers.</p>

<p>"You are nervous," she ventures to say, watching the still,
impassive face, "will you take some valerian, wine, or something?"</p>

<p>"Nothing, Norah," but, all the same, Norah goes out and
comes back with a silver salver holding a small Venetian goblet
of ruby wine.</p>

<p>"Just a few drops," she urges with loving voice, and touching
the glass to the pale lips.</p>

<p>"I think you always take your own way, Norah," her mistress
answers, as she takes the goblet and drains it obediently.
"Now, finish my hair, please, and you can go. It is almost
eleven o'clock."</p>

<p>Silently Norah obeys, gathering up the shining mass in her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
hands, and twisting it into a burnished coil at the back of the
small head where she confines it with a diminutive silver comb.
Then with a wistful sigh, and pitying backward glance, she
says good-night and Grace is left alone.</p>

<p>Alone! how cruelly alone! All her life-time now it seems
to her she will be thus solitary. She leans her small head back,
and stares vacantly at the face whose wondrous beauty is reflected
there in the mirror, and a light scornful smile curves her
lips as she thinks:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">"Is this the form&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That won his praise night and morn?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She thought: my spirit is here alone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Walks forgotten, and is forlorn."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Rising suddenly she threw up the window and looked out
into the night. A gust of cold wind and rain blew into her
face. She faced it a moment, then, shutting down the window
and dropping the crimson curtains together, passed into her
sleeping apartment. But she could not rest. Her downy pillows
might have been a bed of thorns. She rose, and gliding
across the floor and, pausing one moment in grave irresolution,
put her hand on the sliding door of the adjoining nursery,
pushed it open and entered by the light that streamed from her
own apartment.</p>

<p>All was still and silent here. Shadows lay on everything as
heavy as those that clouded her life. She stood gazing mutely
around her for an instant; then, with a low, smothered sob of
agony, rushed forward, and pushing up the sweeping Valenciennes
canopy of the rosewood crib that stood in the center
of the room, buried her face in the small pillow that still held
the impress of a baby's head.</p>

<p>Then silence fell. Some women carry beneath a calm, perhaps
smiling, face, a deeper pain than was ever clothed in words or
tears. The acme of human suffering crushes, paralyzes some
hearts into terrible silence. It was thus with Grace. Her sorrow
had sunk to the bottom of the sea of anguish, so deep that
not a ripple on the surface, not a sparkling drop, leaped up to
show where it fell.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span></p>

<p>Ten, fifteen, twenty minutes went by. She lifted her face at
last&mdash;as white and chill as that of the dead, but lighted by</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">"Melancholy eyes divine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The home of woe without a tear."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>She comes to this room as to a grave. Over the grave of the
child of her heart she may never kneel. She fancies it in her mind
sometimes away off under foreign skies, lying in the shadow of
some frowning English church, with not a flower on its low
mound, unless Nature, more loving than cold humanity, has
dropped it there like a jewel in the grass. She sees the sunshine
lying on it in the quiet days, hears the birds&mdash;the only
thing that ever sings in a graveyard&mdash;warbling matin songs and
vesper hymns in the ivy that clings to the imaginary old church.
<i>There</i> she may never kneel&mdash;here are gathered all her simple
mementoes of him&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Playthings upon the carpet,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">And dainty little shoes&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">With snow-white caps and dresses<br /></span>
<span class="i3">That seem too fair to use."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>There is the crib where she has watched his rosy slumbers;
there in the corner is the little bathing-tub where she has seen
the dimpled struggling limbs flashing through the diamond spray
of cold water, like polished marbles; there upon the wall,
smiling down at her in its infantile beauty and joy, hangs the
pictured semblance of the face that her foreboding heart whispers
to her is moldering into kindred dust beneath the coffin-lid.
This room is to her alike a shrine and a grave.</p>

<p>How it rains!</p>

<p>In the dead, unhappy night, when the rain is on the roof, with
what vivid distinctness does memory recall scenes and hopes
that are past. Poor Grace hears the winds and the rain as they
hold their midnight revels outside, and shudders as the thronging
ghosts of memory flit by. Her brief and exquisite wedded
happiness, her love for the dark-eyed husband who has wronged
her so cruelly&mdash;she shudders and tries to put these thoughts
away.</p>

<p>But she cannot. She has tried before. So long as her child<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
was left, with "baby fingers" to "press him from the mother's
breast," she had tried to put her husband away from her heart;
tried to be content with his darling little prototype; tried with
all the strength of her resolute young soul to crush her love for
him. But there are some things that the strongest and bravest
of us cannot do. Love is "beyond us all;" the battle is not always
to the strong; success does not always crown the bravest
efforts. It is something to know that they who fail are sometimes
braver than they who succeed.</p>

<p>Now, when the little child that was such a darling comfort to
her sad, lonely life is so rudely wrested from that yearning heart,
her thoughts irresistibly center about the father of her child.
She had loved her baby best&mdash;the maternal love was more deeply
developed in her than the conjugal&mdash;but even then her husband
had been blessed with a fervent, tender worship that is the overflow
of only such deep, strong natures as hers&mdash;natures prodigal
of sweetness. Latterly, when the terrible news that he had six
months before joined the army of France had come to her with
all its terrible possibilities, she had only begun to fathom the
depths of her unsounded love for him. It amazed herself&mdash;she
put it from her with angry pain, and rushed into the whirl of
social life to keep herself from thinking; wore the mask of
smiles above her pain, and sunned herself in the light of admiring
eyes, but though fashion and pride and station bowed low
to the Senator's deserted wife, acknowledging her calm supremacy
still, though sympathy and curiosity&mdash;(softly be it spoken)
met her with open arms, though the wine-cup circled in the gay
and brilliant coterie, it held no Lethean draught for her, and
weary and heart-sick she turned from it all, and sought oblivion
in the seclusion of home, and the ever welcome company of
cheerful Lulu Clendenon. But her heart would not be satisfied
thus. Failing in its earthly love and hope, true to itself through
all her mistakes and follies, the heaven-born soul yearned for
more than all this to fill up its aching vacancy, for more than
all this to bind round the tortured heart and keep it from
breaking.</p>

<p>"Where shall I turn?" she asked herself, as with folded arms
she paced the floor with rapid steps, keeping time to the falling
rain outside that poured in swift torrents as "though the heart<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
of heaven were breaking in tears o'er the fallen earth." Human
love, human ties seemed lost to her, earth offered no refuge
from her suffering. Poor, wronged, and tortured young spirit,
"breathing in bondage but to bear the ills she never wrought"&mdash;where
could she turn but to Him who pours the oil of comfort
on wounds that in His strange providence may grow to be
"blessings in disguise?"</p>

<p>She paused in the middle of the floor, lifting her eyes mournfully
upward, half-clasping her hands, wavered an instant, then
falling on her knees, lifted reverent hands and eyes, while from
her lips broke the humble rhymic prayer:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Other refuge have I none,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Helpless to Thy cross I cling;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Cover my defenseless head<br /></span>
<span class="i3">With the shadow of Thy wing."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Surely, if "He giveth his angels charge concerning us," that
pure, heart-wrung petition floated upward on wings seraphic.</p>

</p>


<p>On the following Christmas morning Mrs. Clendenon, Mrs.
Winans and Lulu, together with the returned captain, all attended
divine service at the Protestant Episcopal Church.</p>

<p>It seems strange how many of us become recognized members
of the Church of Christ under religious conviction, without
ever having any great and realizing sense of the saving power
of God, not only in the matter of the world beyond, but in
the limitless power of sustaining us among the trials of this.</p>

<p>This had been peculiarly the case with our heroine. She had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
for years been a member of the Episcopal Church, and, as the
world goes, a dutiful member. But religion had been to her
mind too much in the abstract, too much a thing above and beyond
her to be taken into her daily life in the part of a comforter
and sustainer. She had gone to the world for consolation
in the hour of her trial. It had failed her. To-day as the
glorious old "Te Deum" rose and soared grandly through the
arches of the temple of worship, filling her soul with sublime
pathos, she began to see how He, who had dimly held to her
the place of a Saviour in the world beyond, is an ever-present
Comforter and sustainer in the fateful Gethsemane of this
probationary earth.</p>

<p>Captain Clendenon, as he sat by her side and heard the low,
musical voice as it uttered the prayerful responses to the Litany,
thought her but little lower than the angels. She in her deep
and newly roused humility felt herself scarcely worthy to take
the name of a long misunderstood Saviour on her lips. Few of
the congregation who commented, on dispersing, relative to
the pearl-fair beauty and elegant apparel of the Senator's deserted
wife, fathomed the feelings that throbbed tumultuously
beneath that pale calm bearing as they left the sacred edifice.</p>

<p>"Lulu," she queried later, as up in the young lady's dressing-room
they had laid aside their warm wrappings and furs.
"Lulu, what do you do for Christ?"</p>

<p>Lulu turned about in some surprise:</p>

<p>"What do I do for Christ?" she repeated. "Oh, Gracie, too
little, I fear."</p>

<p>"'Tell me," she persisted.</p>

<p>"Well, then, I have my Sabbath-school class, my list of
Christ's poor, whom I visit and aid to the best of my ability,
my missionary fund, and finally, Gracie, dearest, whatever my
hand 'findeth to do,' I try to do with all my might."</p>

<p>Gracie stood still, twisting one of the long curls that swept
to her waist over one diamond-ringed white finger.</p>

<p>"Darling, why do you ask?" Lulu said, with her arm about
the other's waist.</p>

<p>The fair cheek nestled confidingly against Lulu's own.</p>

<p>"I want to help you, if you will let me&mdash;let me go with you
on your errands for Christ. I belong to the world no longer.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
Show me how to fill up the measure of my days with prayerful
work for the Master."</p>

<p>One pearly drop from Lulu's eyes fell down on the golden
head that had pillowed itself on her breast.</p>

<p>"God, I thank Thee," she murmured, "that there is joy in
heaven to-day over the lamb that has come into the fold."</p>

<p>She whispered it to Brother Willie that day at a far corner of
the parlor when they happened to be alone for a moment
together.</p>

<p>He glanced across at the slender, stately figure standing at
the window between the falling lace curtains, looking wistfully
out.</p>

<p>"It is natural," he said. "A nature so pure, so strong, so
devotional as hers must needs have more than the world can
give to satisfy its immortal cravings. Poor girl! she is passing
through the fire of affliction. Let us thank God that she is
coming out <i>pure gold</i>."</p>

<p>After awhile, when Lulu had slipped from the room, leaving
them alone together, he crossed over to her side, and began telling
her of his experiences and adventures abroad. She listened,
pleased and interested, soothed by his kind, almost brotherly
tone.</p>

<p>"You do not ask me after Winans," said he, playfully, at
last.</p>

<p>She did not answer, save by a heightened flush.</p>

<p>"You did not know that through his reckless bravery, his
gentleness and humanity to his men, he has risen to the rank of
general in the army of France?" A soldierly flash in the clear
gray eyes.</p>

<p>"Yes," she answered in a low voice; "I have seen it in the
newspapers."</p>

<p>"You have? Then you have seen also that he&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He paused, looking down at her quiet face in some perplexity
and doubt.</p>

<p>"That he&mdash;what?" she asked, looking up at him, and growing
slightly pale.</p>

<p>"I do not know how to tell you, if you do not know," his
eyes, full of grave compassion, fixed on hers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span></p>

<p>One of her small hands groped blindly out, and clung firmly
to his arm.</p>

<p>"Captain Clendenon, I know that the Franco-Prussian war is
ended. Is that what you mean? Is he&mdash;my husband&mdash;is he
coming home&mdash;to America?"</p>

<p>She read in his eyes the negative she felt she could not
speak.</p>

<p>"Tell me," she said, desperately, "if he is not coming home,
what is it? I am braver than you think. I can bear a great
deal. Is he&mdash;is he&mdash;<i>dead</i>?"</p>

<p>"May God have mercy on your poor, tired little soul," he
answered, solemnly. "It is more than we know. In the last
great battle, General Winans was wounded near unto death, and
left on the field. When search was made for him he was not
found. Whatever his fate was&mdash;whether he was buried, unshrouded
and uncoffined, like many of those poor fellows, in an
unknown grave, or whether an unknown fate met him, is as yet
uncertain. We hope for the best while we fear the worst."</p>

<p>One hand still lay on his coat-sleeve&mdash;the other one followed
it, clasped itself over it, and she laid her white face down upon
them, creeping closer to him as if to shield herself against his
strong, true heart from the storms that beat on her frail woman-life.
One moment he felt the wild throb of her agonized heart
against his own; then all was still. Lifting the lifeless form on
his arm, he laid it on a sofa and called to Lulu:</p>

<p>"I had to tell her!" he exclaimed. "She did not bear it as
well as we hoped. I am afraid I have killed her."</p>

<p>Ah! grief seldom kills. If it did, this fair world would not
have so many of us striving, busy atoms struggling for its possession.</p>

<p>She came back to life again, lying still and white in Lulu's
loving arms. Captain Clendenon and his mother went out and
left them together. They would not intrude on the sore heart
whose wound they could not heal.</p>

<p>"After all we can hope still," Lulu said, cheerily. "All is
uncertainty and mere conjecture. We can still hope on, until
something more definite is known."</p>

<p>"Hope," repeated the listener, mournfully.</p>

<p>"Hope, yes," was the firm reply. "Hope and pray. One of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
Brother Willie's favorite maxims is that hope springs eternal in
the human breast!"</p>

<p>"I can bear it," came softly from the other. "I have borne
so much, I can still endure. With God's help I will be patient
under all."</p>

<p>"Whom He loveth He chasteneth," answered Lulu.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When New Year's Day came with its social gayeties, receptions,
and friendly calls, one of Lulu's latest and most surprising
visits was from our old friend, Bruce Conway. He had not
called on her for a long time, and she had heard that he was in
Washington. The warm blood suffused her face as she stood
alone in the parlor, with his card in her hand, and it grew rosier
as he entered, and with his inimitable, indolent grace, paid the
compliments of the season.</p>

<p>"You do not ask me where I have been these many days," he
said, as he sipped the steaming mocha she offered him in the
daintiest of China cups. She never offered her friends wine.</p>

<p>"I had heard that you were in Washington," she answered,
apologetically.</p>

<p>"Right&mdash;and what was I doing there? Can you undertake
to guess?"</p>

<p>"I am sure it is beyond me." This with her most languid
air. "Flirting, perhaps."</p>

<p>A light smile curves his mustached lip. Certainly this little
beauty, he thinks, is "good at guessing."</p>

<p>"Have your callers been many to-day?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Quite a number of my friends have called&mdash;all, I think. I
expect no more this evening," she answers, demurely.</p>

<p>"I am glad of that. I shall have you all to myself, Lulu&mdash;willful,
indifferent still, since you will not ask my object in
Washington, I will e'en tell you anyhow."</p>

<p>"Go on&mdash;I am listening."</p>

<p>Putting down the cup he had finished, he seated himself on
the sofa by her side, good-humoredly taking no notice of the
fact that she moved a little farther away from him.</p>

<p>"How pretty you are looking, <i>ma belle</i>. Your blue silk is the
loveliest shade&mdash;so becoming; your laces exquisite. Scarlet
geraniums in your hair&mdash;ah! Lulu, for whose sake?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span></p>

<p>"Not for yours," she flashes, with a hot remembrance that he
has always liked her in scarlet geraniums.</p>

<p>A slow smile dawns in his eyes&mdash;his lips keep their pretense
of gravity.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Her hair is braided not for me,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Her eye is turned away."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>he begins to hum.</p>

<p>"All this is not telling me what mischief you were at in Washington?"
she interrupts.</p>

<p>"Oh," trying to look demure, but woefully failing, "no mischief
at all&mdash;only paying off old scores&mdash;spoiling Fontenay's fun
for him as he did for me last winter.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Satan finds some mischief still<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For idle hands to do."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"Miss Clendenon, you are hard on a poor follow. Why don't
you ask <i>her</i> name; if she is pretty; if she is in the 'set;' if she
is rich; and so on, <i>ad infinitum</i>?"</p>

<p>"I hardly care to know," she answers, with pretty unconcern.</p>

<p>"Hardly care to know&mdash;now, really? I shall tell you anyhow.
Well, she is an heiress; is pretty; in her second Washington
season; father in the banking business, and Fontenay, despairing
of winning you, has transferred his 'young affections'
to her. She rather likes him&mdash;will marry him, perhaps, but
then&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But then?"</p>

<p>"She likes me, too, and I have teased the gallant captain considerably.
Oh, the drives I have had with the fair Cordelia, the
gas-light flirtations; the morning strolls to the capitol; the art-gallery;
everywhere, in short, where you went with the major.
I am not sure but she would throw him over for me altogether."</p>

<p>Her heart sinks within her. Has his fickle love turned from
her so soon to this "fair Cordelia?" Better so, perhaps, for her
in the end; but now&mdash;oh! she has never loved him so well as at
this moment, sitting beside her in his dusk patrician beauty,
with a certain odd earnestness underlying his flippant manner.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Conway is well, I hope?" she says, to change that
painful conversation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span></p>

<p>"Is well?&mdash;yes, and misses you amid the gay scenes of the
capital. What have <i>you</i> been doing secluded here in your quiet
home, little saint?"</p>

<p>"Oh! nothing particularly."</p>

<p>"You have not been falling in love, have you?"</p>

<p>"Why?" with an irrepressible blush.</p>

<p>"I wanted to know&mdash;that is all. Brownie, Aunt Conway, and
I are going abroad this spring to stay, oh, ever so long."</p>

<p>He is watching her narrowly. She knows it, and changes her
sudden start into one of pretty affected surprise.</p>

<p>"Oh, indeed! Will wedding cards and the 'fair Cordelia'
bear you company?"</p>

<p>"Not if some one else will. Brownie, cannot you guess why
I have come here this evening?" his voice growing eagerly
earnest, a genuine love and earnestness shining in his eyes.</p>

<p>"To make a New Year's call, I guess," she answers, with innocent
unconsciousness in her large dark eyes, and the faintest
dimples around her lips.</p>

<p>"Guess again, Brownie?"</p>

<p>"I cannot; I have not the faintest idea," turning slightly
from him.</p>

<p>"Then, Brownie," taking her unwilling hand in his. "I
have come to ask you for a New Year's gift."</p>

<p>A scarlet geranium is fastened in with the lace at her throat.
She plucks it out and holds it toward him with a mischievous
smile.</p>

<p>"Will you take this? I am sorry it is all I have to offer."</p>

<p>He takes the hand that holds the flower and puts it to his
lips.</p>

<p>"It is all I ask; so your heart comes with it."</p>

<p>Vainly she tries to draw back; he holds the small hand
tighter, bending till his breath floats over her forehead.</p>

<p>"Lulu, I did not come here for the gift of a hot-house flower,
though coming from you it is dearer than would be a very
flower from those botanical gardens that are the glory of Washington.
I wanted a rarer flower&mdash;even yourself."</p>

<p>Her face is hidden in one small hand. In low tones she answers:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span></p>

<p>"I thought this matter was settled long ago. Did I not tell
you no?"</p>

<p>There is a long pause. Presently he answers, with a wondrous
patience for him:</p>

<p>"You did, and rightly <i>then</i>, for I did not fully appreciate
your pure womanly affection. I thought I could easily win you,
and having lost you I loved you more. Lulu, I am woefully in
earnest. Refuse me now, and you, perhaps, drive me away
from you for years&mdash;it may be forever. I love you more than I
did then&mdash;a thousand times better."</p>

<p>Still she is silent.</p>

<p>"Brownie," he pleads, "I am not so fickle as you think me.
I have fancied many pretty women, but only loved two&mdash;Grace
Grey and yourself. My love for her is a thing of the past, and
has to do with the past only&mdash;'echoes of harp-strings that broke
long ago'&mdash;my love for you is a thing of the present, and will
influence my whole future. You can make of me a nobler man
than what I am. Willard is willing, your mother is willing, I
have asked them both. Brownie, let us make of that Continental
trip a wedding tour?"</p>

<p>Her shy eyes lifted, meeting in his a deeper love than she has
ever expected to see in them for her.</p>

<p>"Let me see," he goes on, "Aunt Conway and I are going to
Europe in June&mdash;that is time enough for you to get ready.
Think of it, Brownie, I am to be gone months and months. Can
you bear to let me go alone?"</p>

<p>"No, I cannot," she sobs, hiding her face against his shoulder;
and Bruce takes her in his arms and kisses her with a genuine
fondness, prizing her, after the fashion of most men, all the
better because she was so hard to win.</p>

<p>Fair Lulu found so little time amid the preparations that
went so swiftly forward for her marriage that she was very glad
to avail herself of Grace's offered assistance in looking after her
poor people, her missionary box, &amp;c., and so the lonely and depressed
young creature found something to occupy her time as
well as to fill up her thoughts. She was of great assistance, too,
to Lulu in the selection and purchase of the bridal trousseau in
which she took a pleasant feminine interest.</p>

<p>Lulu, who deferred always to her friend's exquisite taste,
would suffer nothing to be purchased until first pronounced
<i>comme il faut</i> by Mrs. Winans; and Bruce Conway, who had
returned in the midst of the season from Washington, and
haunted Lulu's steps with lover-like devotion, declared that his
most dangerous rival in Lulu's heart was Mrs. Winans.</p>

<p>The old yearning passion he had felt for Grace had passed
into a dream of the past; something he never liked to recall,
because there was something of pain about it still like the soreness
of an old wound&mdash;"what deep wound ever healed without
a scar?" But they were very good friends now&mdash;not cordial&mdash;they
would never be that, but still very pleasant and genial to
each other.</p>

<p>Mrs. Conway, who was very well pleased to see Bruce about to
marry, wished it to be so, Lulu wished it to be so; and these
two who had been so much to each other, and who were so little
now, tried, and succeeded in overcoming a certain embarrassment
they felt, and for Lulu's sake, and not to shadow her happiness,
endured each other's presence.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Winans," he had said one day, when some odd chance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
had left them alone together in Lulu's parlor, "it is an unpleasant
thing to speak of. Yet I have always wanted to tell you
how, from the very depths of my soul, I am sorry that any folly
of mine has brought upon you so much unmerited suffering.
Can you ever forgive me?"</p>

<p>She glanced up at him from the small bit of embroidery that
occupied her glancing white fingers, her eyes a thought bluer
for the moment with the stirring of the still waters that flowed
through the dim fields of memory and the pure young spirit
came up a moment to look at him through those serene orbs.</p>

<p>"Can I, yes," she answered, gravely. "When I pray,
nightly, that Our Father will forgive me my trespasses as I forgive
those who trespass against me, my heart is free from ill-feeling
toward any one. How else could I expect to be forgiven?"</p>

<p>And Lulu's entrance, with a song on her happy lips, had put
an end to the conversation that was never again revived between
them.</p>

<p>And days, and weeks, and months went by and brought June.
In that month the wedding was to be, and Lulu and her mother,
beginning to realize the parting that loomed up so close before
them, began to make April weather in the home that had been
all sunshine.</p>

<p>But "time does not stop for tears." The fateful day came
when Lulu, in her white silk dress, and floating vail and orange
blossoms, stood before the altar and took on her sweet lips the
vow to be faithful until death do us part, and, as in a dream,
she was whirled back to her home to the wedding reception and
breakfast, after which she was to depart on that European
tour.</p>

<p>Is there any need to describe it all? Do not all wedding
breakfasts look and taste very nearly alike? Do not all our
dear "five hundred friends" say the same agreeable things
when they congratulate us? Is it not to be supposed that the
bridal reception of the charming Miss Clendenon and the elegant
Bruce Conway is <i>comme il faut</i>? We are not good at describing
such things, dear reader, so we will leave it all to your
imagination, which we know will do it ample justice. We want
to follow Captain Clendenon and Mrs. Winans as they slowly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
promenade the back parlor where the wedding gifts are displayed
for the pleasure of the wedding guests.</p>

<p>"Now, is not that an exquisite set of bronzes?" she is saying,
with her hand lightly touching his arm. "And that silver tea-service
from the Bernards&mdash;is it not superb? That statuette I
have never seen equaled. Ah, see! there is the gift of Major
Fontenay, that ice-cream set in silver, lined with gold. That is
generous in him&mdash;is it not, poor fellow?"</p>

<p>"To my mind, that exquisitely bound Bible is the prettiest
thing in the collection," he returns.</p>

<p>"It is beautiful. That is from her Sunday-school children.
This ruby necklace, set in gold and pearls, is from Mrs. Conway&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And this?" he touches a sandal-wood jewel casket, satin-lined,
and holding a pair of slender dead-gold bracelets with
monograms exquisitely wrought in diamonds&mdash;"this is&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My gift to Lulu."</p>

<p>"Oh! they are beautiful, as are all the things. But, do you
know, Mrs. Winans, that I am so old-fashioned in my ideas that
I do not approve of the habit of making wedding presents&mdash;no,
I do not mean where friendship or love prompts the gift&mdash;but
the indiscriminate practice, you understand!"</p>

<p>"You are right; but in the case of your sister, Captain Clendenon,
I think that the most of her very pretty collection of
wedding gifts are the spontaneous expressions of genuine affection
and respect. Lulu is very much beloved among her circle
of friends."</p>

<p>"You, at least," he says, reflectively, "will miss her greatly.
You have so long honored her by your preference for her society
and companionship. How will you fill up the long months
of her absence?"</p>

<p>She sighs softly.</p>

<p>"She has left me a precious charge&mdash;all her poor to look after,
her heathen fund, her sewing society&mdash;much that has been her
sole charge heretofore, and which I fear may be but imperfectly
fulfilled by me. Still I will do my best."</p>

<p>"You always do your best, I think, in all that you undertake,"
says this loyal heart.</p>

<p>"Whatever is worth doing at all is worth doing well, I think,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
she answers, with a faint flush evoked by his quiet meed of
praise.</p>

<p>Then people begin to flock in to look at the wedding gifts
and at Grace Winans, who is the loveliest thing of all. She has
on a wedding garment in the shape of pale violet silk, with overdress
of cool muslin, trimmed with Valenciennes, white kid
gloves and turquois ornaments set in pearls. The wedding
guests wore their bonnets, and she had a flimsy affair of white
lace studded with pansies on the top of her graceful head. Her
dress was somewhat after the style of fashionable half-mourning.
She had selected it purposely because not knowing if she
were wife or widow a more showy attire was repugnant to her
feelings.</p>

<p>"This," she said, touching a costly little prayer-book with
golden cross, monogram, and clasps. "This, I fancy, is from
you."</p>

<p>"You are right," he answered. "This set of the poets so
handsomely bound is from mother. But are you not weary of
looking at all these things? Shall we not go and find Lulu?"</p>

<p>"By the way," she says, idly, as they slowly pass through
the politely staring throng, exchanging frequent nods and smiles
with acquaintances, and occasional compliments with more intimate
friends, "there is a report&mdash;have you heard it?&mdash;from
Memphis, Tennessee&mdash;of the <i>yellow fever</i>."</p>

<p>"Yes," he answers, slowly. "I have heard the faintest rumor
of it," looking down with a cloud in his clear eyes at the fair
inscrutable face. "Are you worried about it? I remember to
have heard you say your nearest relatives were there."</p>

<p>"Only distant relatives," she answers, composedly. "I am
no more worried about them than about the other inhabitants
of that city. My relatives had little sympathy for me in the
days of my bereavement and destitution, and though one may
overlook and forgive such things one does not easily forget."</p>

<p>He was looking at her all the time she was speaking, though
her eyes had not lifted to his. On the sweet, outwardly serene
face he saw the impress of a growing purpose. What it was he
dared not whisper to his own heart.</p>

<p>The cloud only leaves his brow when they reach his radiant
sister. She stands beneath a bridal arch of fragrant white blossoms,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
roses, and lilies, and orange blossoms dropping their
pendant leaves down over her head as she receives the congratulations
and adieus of her friends before she goes to change her
bridal robe for the traveling-dress in which she is to start for
the other shores of the Atlantic. Conway is beside her, nonchalant,
smiling, handsome, very well satisfied with himself and
the world. As his glance falls on the fair, pensive face of the
Senator's deserted wife, the smile forsakes his lip, one sigh is
given to the memory of "what might have been," and turning
again to his young bride, the past is put away from him forever,
and he is content.</p>

<p>And presently the new-made Mrs. Conway flits up stairs with
Gracie, to array herself in the sober gray traveling-silk.</p>

<p>Grace parts the misty folds of the bridal vail and kisses the
pearl-fair forehead.</p>

<p>"Oh, darling!" she whispers, "may God be very good to you&mdash;may
he bless you in your union with the man of your choice."</p>

<p>Lulu's tears, always lying near the surface, begin to flow.</p>

<p>"Oh, Gracie," she says, suddenly, "if all should not be as we
fear&mdash;if I should chance to see your husband on the shores of
Europe, may I tell him&mdash;remember he has suffered so much&mdash;may
I tell him that you take back the words you said in the first
agony of your baby's loss?"</p>

<p>"What was it I said?" asked Gracie, with soft surprise.</p>

<p>"Do you not remember the night you were taken ill, when
you were half delirious, and he came to see you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<i>Did</i> he come to see me?" interrupts Grace.</p>

<p>"Certainly&mdash;don't you remember? You were half delirious,
and you fancied your husband had hidden away the child to
worry you, and you said&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I said&mdash;oh, what did I say, Lulu?" breathed the listener,
impatiently.</p>

<p>Lulu stopped short, looking, in surprise, at the other.</p>

<p>"Gracie, is it possible that you were entirely delirious, and
that you recollect nothing of your husband's visit and your refusal
to see him?"</p>

<p>"This is the first I ever knew of it," said Grace, sadly; "but
go on, Lulu, and tell me, please, what I did say."</p>

<p>"You refused to see him, though entreated to do so by Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
Conway; you said you would never see him&mdash;never, never&mdash;unless
he came with the missing child in his arms."</p>

<p>"Did I say all that, Lulu?" asked Grace, in repentant surprise.</p>

<p>"All that, and more. You said that if he attempted to enter
your room you would spring from the window&mdash;and he was in
the parlor; he heard every word from your own lips."</p>

<p>"Oh, Lulu, I must have been delirious; I remember nothing
of all that, and it has, perhaps, kept him from me all the time,"
came in a moan from the unhappy young creature, as she leaned
against the toilet-table, with one hand clasping her heart.</p>

<p>Lulu caught up a bottle of eau-de-cologne and showered the
fine, fragrant spray over the white face, just as Mrs. Clendenon
hurried in.</p>

<p>"My darling, do you know you should have been down stairs
before this time&mdash;hurry, do."</p>

<p>And too much absorbed in her own grief to observe the ill-concealed
agitation of Mrs. Winans, or attributing it to her sorrow
at losing Lulu, the mother assisted the young bride to
change her white silk for her traveling one.</p>

<p>Then for one moment Lulu flung herself in passionate tears
on her friend's breast, with a hundred incoherent injunctions
and promises, from which she was disturbed by the entrance of
Mrs. Conway, radiantly announcing that the carriage waited
and they had no time to spare. And Lulu, lingering only for a
blessing from her mother's lips, a prayerful "God bless you"
from her brother's, went forth with hope on her path, love in
her heart, and the sunshine on her head, to the new life she had
chosen.</p>

<p>When the last guest had departed, the "banquet fled, the
garland dead," Mrs. Winans removed her bonnet, and spent the
remainder of the day in diverting the sad mother whose heart
was aching at the loss of her youngest darling.</p>

<p>"It seems as if all the sunshine had gone out of the house
with her," Willard said, sadly, to Grace, as they stood looking
together at the deserted bridal arch that seemed drooping and
fading, as if in grief for the absent head over which it had lately
blossomed. "I fancied we should keep our baby with us
always in the dear home nest; but she is gone, so soon&mdash;a wife<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
before I had realized she had passed the boundaries of childhood."</p>

<p>"The months of absence will pass away very quickly," she
said, gently, trying to comfort him as best she could, "and you
will have her back with you."</p>

<p>"I don't know," he said, with a half-sob in his manly voice,
lifting a long, trailing spray of white blossoms that an hour
before he had seen resting against the dear brown head of his
sister, touching it tenderly to his lips&mdash;"I don't know, Mrs.
Winans. I don't believe in presentiments&mdash;I am not at all
superstitious&mdash;but to-day, when I kissed my sister's lips in farewell,
a chill crept through my frame, a voice, that seemed as
clear and distinct as any human voice, seemed to whisper in
my ear, '<i>Never again on this side of eternity!</i>' <i>What</i> did it
mean?"</p>

<p>Ah! Willard Clendenon&mdash;that the fleshly vail that separates
your pure spirit from the angels is so clear that a gleam of your
near immortality glimmered through!</p>

<p>The gossips of Norfolk are weary of wondering at the vagaries
of the Hon. Mrs. Winans. They admired and envied her
very much in the <i>role</i> of queen of beauty and fashion; they
are simply amazed when she glides before the foot-lights in the
garb of a "ministering angel."</p>

<p>When she first began to aid and assist Miss Clendenon in
her charitable undertakings they thought it only natural,
in view of the sudden intimacy that had sprung up between
the two, that the one should be found wherever the other was.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
But it was quite a different thing when the Senator's lovely
and exclusive wife assumed those duties alone. Society,
wounded by her quiet and almost complete withdrawal from
its fascinations, set it down to a lack of a new sensation, and
predicted that as soon as the novelty wore out Mrs. Winans
would seek some newer and fresher hobby.</p>

<p>But quietly oblivious to it all, the young lady went her way,
smoothing with gentle advice and over thoughtful bounty many
a thorny path where poverty walked falteringly on, lending a
patient and sympathetic ear to the grievous complaints that
rose from the homes of want and distress, strangely gentle to
all little children, careful of their needs, thoughtful of their
future, dropping the gentle promises of Christ along darkened
paths barren of such precious seeds, and often society
was scandalized by the not unfrequent sight of the young
lady taking out for an airing on the cool, breezy suburbs or
sea-shore some puny child or ailing adult from the haunts of
poverty and making them comfortable by her side in that darling
little phaeton that all Norfolk ran to their windows to gaze
at when it passed.</p>

<p>Miss Lavinia Story&mdash;dear old spinster!&mdash;undertook to interview
the lady on the subject of her going so far in alleviating
the "fancied wants and grievances of those wretched poor
trash," and was fairly driven from the field when Mrs. Winans,
with a glimmer of mischief under her black lashes and a very
serious voice asked her if her leisure would admit of her joining
the sewing society, of which she was manager.</p>

<p>"For indeed," said Grace, half playfully, half in earnest, "we
are in want of workers very badly. A lady from 'our set' volunteered
very kindly last week as operator on the sewing-machine
I donated the society, and they are so dreadfully in want
of basters. Surely, Miss Lavinia, you will enlist as baster&mdash;that,
if not more. Think of the poor people who need clothing so
badly, and say 'yes.'"</p>

<p>"I? I would not spoil <i>my</i> eyesight with everlasting stitching
for poor people, who are always lazy and shiftless, and
smell of onions," said Miss Story, loftily.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, I am sure," smoothly returned her merciless
tormentor. "I forgot that your eyesight cannot be as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
strong as it once was. Perhaps you would not object to becoming
a visitor of the sick, or something of that sort."</p>

<p>"My eyesight not as strong as it once was?" returned the
lady, in perceptible anger. "You mistake very much, Mrs.
Winans; my eyes are as young as they ever were" (she was fifty
at the least), "but I can use them to better advantage than by
wearing them out in the service of your sewing circle."</p>

<p>"It <i>is</i> rather tedious&mdash;this endless stitching," confessed the
zealous advocate of the sewing society, "but perhaps you would
not object to taking a little sewing at home occasionally&mdash;little
dresses or aprons, and such trifling things for the little folks&mdash;even
that would be a help to us in the present limited number
of workers&mdash;won't you try to help us out that much?"</p>

<p>Miss Lavinia adjusted her spectacles on her high Roman nose,
the better to annihilate with a flashing glance the persistent
young lady whom she felt dimly persuaded in her own mind
was "laughing in her sleeve at her," and Mrs. Winans, with
the pearly edge of one little tooth repressing the smile that
wanted to dimple on her lip, sat demurely expectant.</p>

<p>"I did not call on you, Mrs. Winans, I assure you, to solicit
a situation as seamstress. I never allow myself to be brought
into personal contact with the filthy and odious poor. I do my
share in taking care of them by contributing to the regular poor
fund of the church."</p>

<p>"Oh, indeed?" said the listener, still unmoved and demure.
"I am sure it is very considerate of you and very comforting to
the poor people besides."</p>

<p>"I think, my dear," answered Miss Lavinia, pacified by the
rather equivocal compliment, "that it would be better for you
to confine yourself to the same plan. Let those who have not
our refined and delicate instincts minister to those of the poor
class who are really deserving of pity and of assistance, while
we can do our part just as well by placing our contributions in
the hands of some worthy person who can undertake its proper
distribution. It hardly looks well for a lady of your standing
to be brought into such frequent and familiar intercourse with
the vulgar and low people to be met in the homes of poverty,
if you will pardon such plain speaking from an old friend and
well-wisher."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span></p>

<p>"And so you will not undertake to help us sew," persisted
the placid little tormentor, as the rustle of Miss Story's brown
silk flounces announced impending departure.</p>

<p>"No, indeed&mdash;quite out of the question," answered the irate
spinster, as she hurried indignantly away to report to her gossips,
and only sorry that it was out of her power or that of any
of her peers to socially ostracize the self-possessed young advocate
of the sewing society.</p>

<p>"The most persistent little woman you ever saw," she said.
"I fairly thought she'd have coaxed me into that low sewing-circle,
or sent me away with a bundle of poor children's rags to
mend. I won't undertake to advise her again in a hurry; and
my advice to all of her friends is to let her alone. She is 'joined
to her idols.'"</p>

<p>And the "persistent little woman" ran up stairs and jotted
down a spirited account of her pleasant sparring with the spinster
in her friendly, even sympathetic journal&mdash;the dear little
book to which was confided the gentle thoughts of her pure
young heart.</p>

<p>"Dear little book," she murmured, softly fluttering the scented
leaves and glancing here and there at little detatched jottings
in her pretty Italian text, "how many of my thoughts, nay
hopes and griefs are recorded here."</p>

<p>Now and then a smile dawns in her blue eyes, and anon her
sweet lip quivers as the written record of a joy or grief meets
her gaze. Looking back over earlier years, the pleasures of the
fleeting hours, the dawning hopes of maidenhood, the deep,
wild sorrow of her slighted love, she suddenly pauses, her finger
between the pages, and says to herself with a half-sad
smile:</p>

<p>"And this was about the time when I fancied myself a poet.
Why have I not torn this out long ago? I wonder why I have
kept this foolish rhyme all these years?"</p>

<p>In soft, murmuring tones she read it aloud, a faint inflection
of scorn running through her low, musical voice:</p>

</p>

<p>"Rue!" she repeats, with a low, bitter laugh; "ah, me, I
have been gathering a harvest of <i>rue</i> all my life."</p>

<p>The leaves fall together over the sorrowful, girlish rhyme, the
book drops from her hand, and, sighing, she throws herself
down on a low divan of cushioned pale blue silk, looking idly
out of the open window at the evening sky glowing with the
opalescent hues of a summer's sunset.</p>

<p>"I daresay it's quite natural to make a dunce of one's self
once in a life-time," she muses, "and I presume there is a
practical era in every one's life. All the same I wish it had
never come to me; the consequences have followed me through
life."</p>

<p>Her small hand goes up to her throat, touching the spring
of the pearl-studded locket she wears there. The lid flying open
shows the dusk glory of Paul Winans' pictured face smiling on
her through a mist of her own tears.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span></p>

<p>"And I drove you from me. Lulu says I did it; spoke my
own doom with fever-parched, delirious lips! <i>Why</i> did they
believe me? Why did they not tell me of it long ago? They
should have known I could not have been so cruel! All this
time you have thought I hated you, all this time I have
thought you hated me! You <i>did</i> come; you did want to make
peace with your wronged though willful wife. It is joy to know
that though too late for hope even. Why did I go to Washington?
Why did I go in defiance of his will? All might have
been well with us ere this. Both of them&mdash;the darling baby and
the darling father&mdash;might have been mine now. Instead&mdash;oh,
Heaven, Paul dearest, you will never know now&mdash;unless, perchance,
you are in heaven&mdash;how deeply, how devotedly I loved
you! Who is to blame? Ah, me! It is all <i>rue</i>!"</p>

<p>A moment her lips trembled against the pictured face, then
she shuts it with a snap, and lies with closed eyes and compressed
lips, thinking deeply and intensely, as "hearts too
much alone" always think. But with the passing moments her
sudden heart-ache softens a little. Rousing herself she walks
over to the window, saying, with a faint, fluttering sigh:</p>

<p>"Ah, well! 'Fate is above us all.'"</p>

<p>How sweet the air is! The salt breeze catches the odor of the
mignonette in her window, and wafts it to her, lifting the soft
tresses from her aching temples with its scented breath, and
with the sublime association that there is in some faint flower
perfumes and grief, the bitter leaven at her heart swells again
with all the painful luxury of sorrow.</p>

<p>"I am so weary of it all&mdash;life's daily treadmill round! What
is it worth? How is it endurable when love is lost to us?"</p>

<p>Ah! poor child! Love is not all of life. When love is lost
life's cares and duties still remain. We <i>must</i> endure it. Well
for us that God's love is over all.</p>

<p>Some thought like this calms the seething waves of passion in
her heart. She picks up her journal from the floor where it
had fallen, and listlessly tears out the page that holds the simple
rhyme of her girlhood's folly. Leaning on the window she
takes it daintily between her fingers and tears it into tiny bits
that scatter like snow-flakes down on the graveled path of the
garden below.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span></p>

<p>"Loved by two," she says, musingly. "What was Bruce
Conway's love worth, I wonder? Or Paul Winans' either, for
that matter? The one fickle, unstable, the other jealous,
proud, unbending as Lucifer! Not quite my ideal of perfect
love, either one of them! After all, what is any man's love
worth, I wonder, that it should blight a woman's life?"</p>

<p>Loved by three she might have said, but she did not know.
How much the fleshly vail between our spirits hides from our
finite eyes. How often and often a purer, better, stronger love
than we have ever known is laid in silence at our feet, over
which we walk blinded and never know the truth.</p>

<p>And yet by some odd chance, nay, rather unconscious prescience,
she thinks of Willard Clendenon, recalling his words on
the day of his sister's marriage:</p>

<p>"Never again on this side of eternity."</p>

<p>"What did it mean?" she mused aloud. "It was strange at
the least. I trust no harm will come to Lulu, little darling.
She is still well and happy, or at least her letters say so." And
drawing from her pocket a letter lately received from Lulu, she
ran over its contents again with all a woman's innocent pleasure
in re-reading letters.</p>

<p>"How happy she seems," a faint smile curving the perfect
lips; "and how devoted is Mr. Conway; how her innocent,
joyous, loving heart mirrors itself in her letters! Sunshine,
roses, honeymoon, bliss. Ah, me," with a light sigh chasing
the smile away, "how evanescent are all things new and sweet;
like that sky late aglow with the radiance of day, now darkening
with the shades of twilight."</p>

<p>Norah comes in to light the gas, and is gently motioned
away.</p>

<p>"Not yet, Norah. I have a fancy to sit in the twilight. You
can come in later."</p>

<p>And Norah goes obediently.</p>

<p>Then she incloses the perfumed pink epistle in the dainty
envelope bearing the monogram of the newly made wife, and
laying it aside rests her head upon her hands, watching with
dusk pained eyes the shadows that darken over the sky and over
her golden head as she sits alone, her heart on fire with that
keenest refinement of human suffering&mdash;"remembering happier<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
things." All her brightness, all her love lies behind her in the
past, in the green land of memory. The present holds no joy,
the future no promise. The dimness of uncertainty, of doubt,
of suspense, lies darkly on the present hour, the hopelessness
of hope clouds the future. Heaven seems so far away as she
lifts her mournful gaze to the purple, mysterious twilight sky,
life seems so long as she remembers how young she is, and what
possibilities for length of days lie before her. What wonder
that her brave, long-tried strength fails her a little, that her
sensitive spirit quails momentarily, and the angel of the human
breast, hope,</p>

<p>A period of three months goes by after Lulu's marriage, swiftly
to those who are gone, slowly to those who remain. Mrs. Clendenon,
in quiet household employments, in prayerful study of her
Bible, fills up the aching void of her daughter's absence. Grace,
in pursuance of the charge Lulu has left her, finds much of her
leisure employed in scenes and undertakings that gently divert
her mind from her own troubles to those of others. Under it
all, the wound that time has only seared lies hidden, as near as
she can hide it, from the probing of careless fingers.</p>

<p>Captain Clendenon shuts himself up in his dusty law office
with his red-tape documents and law books. Of late he has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
covered himself with glory in the winning of a difficult suit at
law, and Norfolk is loud in praise of the one-armed soldier, the
maimed hero who has grown into such an erudite lawyer. He
takes the adulation very quietly. "The time has passed when
he sighed for praise." A shadow lies darkly on his life&mdash;the
shadow of Grace Winans' unhappiness. In that strong, pure
heart of his, no thought of himself, no selfish wish for his own
happiness ever intrudes. Had peace folded his white wings
over her fair head she would long ago have become to his high,
honorable heart, a thing apart from his life, as something fair
and lovely that was dead; and with her safe in the shelter of
another man's love he would have tutored his heart to forget
her. As it was, when he looked on the fair face that was to him
but a reflex of the saintly soul within, his whole soul yearned
over her; his love, which had in it more of heaven than earth,
infolded her within the sphere of its own idolizing influence.
She became to him, not the fair, fascinating, but sometimes
faulty mortal woman the world saw in her, but rather a goddess,
a creature most like</p>

</div></div>

<p>Such worship as this has always been the attribute of the
purest, most unselfish love.</p>

<p>He sat alone in his office one day, his head bowed idly over
Blackstone, his thoughts far away, when the sharp grating of
wheels on the street outside startled him into rising and glancing
out of the window. <i>She</i> was springing from her little pony-phaeton,
and in another moment came flitting down the steps
and into the room like a ray of sunshine.</p>

<p>"Moping, are you?" she asked with her head on one side,
and a glimmer of her old-time jaunty grace.</p>

<p>"Not exactly," he answered, cheerfully bowing over the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
gloved hand she extended with frank sweetness&mdash;"only thinking;
our life is too short for moping."</p>

<p>She might have added:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"I myself must mix with action<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Lest I wither by despair."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"Are you busy?" glancing, as he offered her a seat, at the
table littered with books and papers.</p>

<p>"Not at all; I am at your service," he replied.</p>

<p>"I want to talk to you; but&mdash;excuse me&mdash;your office looks so
gloomy&mdash;makes me <i>blue</i>," she shivered a little. "Is your
mother quite well?"</p>

<p>"Quite well&mdash;thanks. Will you not go up and see her?&mdash;or
shall I bring her down?"</p>

<p>"Thanks&mdash;neither, I believe. I saw her a day or two since,
and I am come on business now. Captain Clendenon, is it quite
<i>comme il faut</i> for a lady to ask you to take a drive? If so, my
phaeton is at your service. I want to ask you something; I
cannot here. Some of your tiresome clients may disturb me."</p>

<p>The soft appealing eyes and voice work their will with this
infatuated man. If she had asked him to lie down under the
hoofs of her cream-white ponies and be trampled on, I fear he
would have done it. A man's love for a woman sometimes rises
above its ordinary ridiculousness into the sublimity of pathos,
and how little it is for him to consent to sit by her side and hear
those magical tones, perhaps give some advice to that ever restless
young spirit. He calls his office boy, takes his hat, and
goes. Presently they are rolling over one of Norfolk's handsome
drives, and censorious people, looking from their windows,
exchange opinions that Mrs. Winans is "rather fast."</p>

</div></div>

<p>"I have been over to Portsmouth this morning," she says, in
the midst of their small talk. "It is rather a nice little jaunt over
there on the ferry-boat over the Elizabeth River&mdash;don't you
think so?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I do think so; had you a nice time?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't know&mdash;yes, I suppose so. I visited some friends,
and we went down and saw the beautiful grounds of the Naval
Hospital&mdash;what a handsome building it is! The pride of Portsmouth.
And what romantic grounds! I sat there a long time
and looked at the sea."</p>

<p>To what is all this idle chatter leading, he wonders, seeing
perfectly well with what consummate art she is leading the subject
whither she wants it to go.</p>

<p>"We were all talking of that dreadful fever at Memphis," she
resumes, constrainedly. "What swift progress it is making!
The newspaper accounts of it are just terrible&mdash;heart-rending,
indeed; and they are so fearfully in need of nurses and money.
I have sent them a small sum&mdash;a mere 'drop in the ocean.'"</p>

<p>"So have I," he answers, white to the lips. He knows what
is coming.</p>

<p>She gives him a flitting glance, fanning herself energetically
the while. A useless proceeding, for the sea-breeze, that flutters
her fair curls like golden banners, is simply delicious.</p>

<p>"I heard something about you over there," she ventures.
"One always has to go abroad to hear news from home, you
know."</p>

<p>"Very likely; you can hear anything you want to over there.
Little Portsmouth is the hot bed of gossip," he answers, smiling
dryly.</p>

<p>"Well, for that matter, all places are," she returns. "But
you do not ask what it was that I heard?"</p>

<p>"Is it worth the repetition?"</p>

<p>"I think so, but you are not interested, I see;" and she leans
back with some displeasure&mdash;a pout on the curve of her crimson
lip.</p>

<p>He rouses himself, all penitence and forced gallantry.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, Mrs. Winans. Any remark from yourself
cannot fail to be interesting."</p>

<p>"I heard&mdash;I wonder you did not tell me of it yourself&mdash;that
you and your mother are going next week to Memphis to help
to nurse the fever patients."</p>

<p>No answer.</p>

<p>"Is this true?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span></p>

<p>Her eyes are seeking his. He looks down on her, answering
constrainedly:</p>

<p>"It is perfectly true, Mrs. Winans."</p>

<p>"Why have you kept it from me?" in some wonder this.</p>

<p>"We intended telling you, of course, before we left; but it is
such a harrowing topic&mdash;the sufferings of those poor yellow fever
patients&mdash;that I have hesitated in mentioning it to you."</p>

<p>"Was that your only reason?"</p>

<p>No answer. He cannot bear to speak.</p>

<p>"I know," she resumes, "why you have not told me. You
feared I would want to go, too, and so kept it from me in your
good, true, brotherly love; but in this case," smiling willfully
up into his disturbed face, "your painstaking has been 'Love's
Labor Lost.' I have been making my mind up to go all along,
and now I mean to make the trip there under the protection of
your mother and yourself&mdash;if you will permit me."</p>

<p>The murder is out. She looks away from him demurely,
waiting his reply. It comes, full of a shocked horror.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Winans, are you mad?"</p>

<p>"Not at all; are you? I am quite as strong, quite as able to
help those poor sufferers, as your mother is; and yet you do not
think she is mad," she answers, half offended.</p>

<p>"No; for she has had the fever, and so have I. You have
heard of the fever that desolated Norfolk and Portsmouth in
1855? Mother and I both had the <i>yellow fever</i> in its worst form
then, so you see it is perfectly safe and our bounden duty for
us to go to the relief of those poor sufferers. But you are frail
and delicate yourself. You have never had the fever; you are
not acclimated there, and would only fall a victim. It would be a
sort of disguised suicide, for you would be voluntarily rushing
into the jaws of death."</p>

<p>"No, no," she answered, half bitterly. "I bear a charmed
life. Nothing seems to check the current of my doomed existence.
And you forget that Memphis is my native home. I
lived there the first sixteen years of my life, and am quite accustomed
to the peculiar climate. And what if death should
come? It would only be to 'leave all disappointment, care,
and sorrow, and be at rest forever,' But no, I shall not die. I
have borne illness, suffering, sorrow&mdash;everything that breaks the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
heart, and snaps the frail threads of existence&mdash;yet here I am
still, quite healthy, passably rosy, and willing to devote my
strength to those who need it. I have been 'through the fire,'
Captain Clendenon, and really," with a subdued smile, "I think
I am <i>fireproof</i>."</p>

<p>"Some are refined in the furnace of affliction," he repeats,
very gently.</p>

<p>Soothed by the softly spoken words, she asks, timidly:</p>

<p>"Tell me if I may go under your care?"</p>

<p>"If you <i>will</i> go, I shall be most happy to take all the annoyances
of travel off your hands; but, little friend, think better
of it, and give up this mad, quixotic scheme."</p>

<p>"Do you think it such a mad scheme?" she asks, mortified
and humiliated. "Do you think I could do no good to those
poor suffering victims who need gentle womanly tending so
badly? Do you think the sacrifice of my ease, and luxury, and
comfort, would count as nothing with Christ? If you think
this, Captain Clendenon, tell me so frankly, and I will remain
in Norfolk&mdash;not otherwise."</p>

<p>There is nothing for him to urge against this appeal. She
touches up the ponies with her slim, little whip, lightly and
impatiently. They are off, like the wind, for home again, as he
makes the last appeal he can think of to this indomitable young
spirit.</p>

<p>"News may come of your husband at any time, Mrs. Winans.
Were you to go, and he, returning, found you gone, he
would be most bitterly displeased. Remember, it was his express
desire that you should remain in your home here. I beg
your pardon, if I seem persistent, but it is only through friendly
interest in you and yours that I take the liberty."</p>

<p>"Ah! but," a gleam of triumph lightening under her black
lashes, "you forget that I have my husband's consent to visit
Memphis? You brought it to me. I'm returning to the home
of my childhood. I am not violating any command or desire
of his."</p>

<p>"Once more," he says, desperately "let me beg you not to
think, for the sake of all those who love you, all you love, of
going to that plague-stricken city."</p>

<p>"It is useless." She set her lips firmly. "I am sorry to refuse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
your request, but the call of duty I must obey. My arrangements
are all made. Norah is to stay and to take care of
my home. My visit to Portsmouth this morning was for the
purpose of leaving Lulu's precious charge in the hands of a dear
Christian friend; so," trying to win him to smile by an affected
lightness, "you may tell your mother she will have company
she did not anticipate, though you were so ungallant as to persuade
me not to come."</p>

<p>"When a woman will she will."</p>

<p>She carried her point against the entreaties of all her friends,
and in less than two weeks, three dusty travelers&mdash;weary in body,
but very strong in prayerful resolves and hopes&mdash;were entered
as assistants in nursing in one of the crowded hospitals of the
desolated, plague-stricken city of Memphis.</p>

<p>One of Grace's first acts after reaching Memphis was to inquire
for her relatives, whom she had not seen, and but seldom
heard from, since leaving Memphis, in her sixteenth year, to
make her own way in the hard world. Not that she owed them
much affection, or any gratitude&mdash;only the natural respect and
remembrance of kinship induced her to seek them out. But
her efforts were not crowned with success, for she learned that
they had been among the first of the native families to flee the
city at the approach of the pestilence, and Grace was greatly
disappointed thereat.</p>

<p>For a few weeks her voluntarily assumed duties were arduous
and embarrassing in the extreme. Mrs. Clendenon and Willard,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
having had the fever themselves, and having been witnesses of
its ravages in their own city, entered at once with confidence
and experience on the task of caring for the poor victims who
filled the hospitals, and even private houses. To Grace it was
all new, and strange, and terrible, and though her will was
strong, her sensitive spirit quailed at the horrors she daily saw,
so unused was she to these scenes, and so diffident of her own
powers for service, that she half doubted her abilities, and was,
for a time, overwhelmed by the feeling which we have all experienced
at times of willingness to perform duties from which
we are deterred by ignorance, or lacking self-confidence.</p>

<p>But this feeling was not long suffered to deter her from
usefulness. Laborers were too sadly needed in the terrible harvest
of death, and as her increasing familiarity with the details
of the awful disease rendered her more efficient, she became
an invaluable nurse to the patients, and a reliable and prized aid
to the physician of the ward where she was placed.</p>

<p>The Clendenons were in the same hospital, and in the performance
of their several duties the trio often met, when a sweet sentence
of praise from the lady, and a cheerful word of encouragement
from him, went far to keep up her flagging spirits, and
stimulate her to renewed exertions.</p>

<p>Her strong, healthy constitution upheld her well in those
days; for the fiery scourge rolled on and on like some great
prairie fire, hourly seizing fresh victims, and erecting its everlasting
monuments in the long rows of new-made graves in the
cemeteries that swelled upward, side by side, close and many,
like the green billows of old ocean, save that they gave back no
solemn, tolling dirge, to tell where youth and love, hope and
beauty, old age and infancy, joy and sorrow, went down to the
stillness of the grave.</p>

<p>In the universal suffering, the universal grief of those around
her, the anguish of those bereaved of whole families, of friends
the young lady put away her own griefs from her heart, and
threw herself, heart, and soul, and body, into her work; and,
though her two friends were doing precisely the same thing,
they pleaded, expostulated, scolded and warned in turn.</p>

<p>All in vain; for a rock would have flown from "its firm base"
as soon as Grace Winans from the position she has taken. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
had, as she pathetically protested, so little to live for, that she
was all the more willing and desirous to sacrifice herself for the
sake of saving others who had more ties in life than herself.</p>

<p>"That is a poor policy," Mrs. Clendenon argued, stoutly.
"You have no right to commit a moral suicide, however few
your ties in life may be. Your life is God's, and He has some
plan in life for you, or He would not have placed you on the
earth."</p>

<p>"And this may have been His plan for me, then," persisted
the candidate for self-sacrificial honors. "He may have meant
for me to take up this very cross. I have been brought to it by
many subtle windings."</p>

<p>"I do not know," Mrs. Clendenon answers, with sweet seriousness,
"that God gives it to us to fathom exactly what are
His plans for us. I think He means for us to take proper care
of the health and strength He has given us, and to do His will
in all things as near as we can, leaving to Him the fulfillment of
the grand plan under which, by His fixed laws, every created
being is a necessary and responsible agent."</p>

<p>And Grace answers only by silence and sadness. For Captain
Clendenon, he has long ceased to argue the question with her
willful spirit, having very implicit confidence in the grand old
adage that</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"When a woman will, she will&mdash;you may depend on't!<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And when she won't, she won't&mdash;and there's an end on't!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"Oddly enough," he says, trying to change the conversation
from its theological turn, "I met with an old comrade to-day&mdash;one
of the boys from my company&mdash;a Virginian, and one of the
bravest in the regiment. He had drifted down here since the
war."</p>

<p>"What was he doing to-day? Nursing in the hospital?" Mrs.
Clendenon asks, curiously.</p>

<p>"<i>Dying</i> in the hospital," the captain answers, with a break in
his clear voice. "Down with the fever&mdash;died this evening."</p>

<p>"Poor boy!" his mother said, pityingly, and a tear in the
younger woman's eye echoed it.</p>

<p>"The worst of it is," the captain goes on, "he leaves a poor,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
timid little wife, and two rosebuds of children&mdash;the mother as
childish and fragile as the rest."</p>

<p>"And what is to become of her?" query both ladies at once.</p>

<p>"I want to send her home to her relatives. She was a Richmond
girl. I remember meeting her there once when my company
passed through on its way to Manassas. Arthur, poor fellow!
invited me to call on her. She was then a charming little
creature, very different from the heart-broken little thing she is
now. Mother, I would like it very much if you would call on
her to-morrow, and try to comfort her a little&mdash;she seems so
friendless and desolate. You, too, Mrs. Winans, if you can conveniently
do so."</p>

<p>Both ladies expressed a desire to visit the bereaved young
widow and her little ones.</p>

<p>"Then I will take you down there to-morrow," he said, gratefully,
with a smile in his honest gray eyes. "Ah! how
it pains me to meet, as one must frequently do here, old friends
and old faces, only to close the lids over eyes that have been so
dear! Poor Arthur! poor boy! but it is one of the sad inevitable
experiences of life."</p>

<p>"Grace, my love," Mrs. Clendenon went on to say, "I have
Doctor Constant's authority to forbid your appearance at the
hospital to-night. He says you are so unremitting in attentions
to his patients that there is danger of your falling sick, and our
losing your valuable services altogether, if you persist in taking
no rest at all."</p>

<p>In the quiet hotel at which all three are registered they are
seated at supper in the small private dining-room. The round,
neatly appointed table at which they sit is loaded with luxuries
to which they are doing but meager justice. It is late in October,
and a small fire burns on the hearth, tempering the slightly
chilly air, and lending cheerfulness to the room. Bright gas-light
glimmers down on crimson carpets, curtains, chairs, that
throw into vivid relief the faces of our three friends&mdash;pale all of
them, and thin, earnest, and full of thoughtful gravity. It is
no child's play, this nursing the yellow fever patients in houses
and hospitals. These faces bear the impress of sleepless nights
and days, and the silver threads on the elder lady's brow are
more abundant, while in Captain Clendenon's curly brown locks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
one or two snow-flakes from the winter of care, not time, are
distinctly visible. There are slight hollows in the smooth cheeks
of Grace, faint blue circles around her large eyes, and no color
at all in her face except the vivid line of her red lips. She looks
like a little Quakeress in the pale gray dress that clings closely
about the slight figure, relieved only by white frills at throat
and wrists. All her bright hair is drawn back in soft waves from
her face, and confined at the back with a silver arrow that lets it
fall in a soft, bright mass of natural curls below the waist&mdash;lovely
still, though pallid, sad, and worn; and in this quiet nun-like
garb, with a beauty that grows daily less earthly, and more
heavenly.</p>

<p>The pensive shade of a smile dwells on her lip a moment as
she looks across on Mrs. Clendenon in mute rebellion at the
physician's mandate.</p>

<p>"You need not look defiance," the lady returns, "for I shall
add my commands to those of Doctor Constant. This is Thursday,
and you have not slept a single night this week, while I
have had two nights' rest. My dear child, listen to reason, and
remain at the hotel to-night and get some sleep."</p>

<p>"I am not so very tired. I can hold out to watch to-night."</p>

<p>"Oh, of course! and die at your post. What can you be
thinking of, Grace? Flesh and blood cannot stand such a
strain. You must take needful rest, or you will fall a victim to
the fever through sheer exhaustion."</p>

<p>"I cannot rest," she answered, wearily. "It is a physical
impossibility for me to take rest and sleep when I know how
many are suffering and needing attention that I could render
them."</p>

<p>"There are others who will supply your place," interposed
the captain. "I learned this evening that you were at two
death-beds to-day. This, I think, is too much strain on your
nervous system, and did I dare I should add my commands to
the rest that you remain in your room and take needful repose
to-night. As it is, I can only offer my earnest entreaties."</p>

<p>The resolute look on her face relaxes a little. She looks up to
this quiet, clear-headed captain much as Lulu does; has great
respect for his judgment; wishes sometimes that he were her
brother, too&mdash;that her tired young heart might rest against his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
brave and grand strength. He sees the half-relenting in her
face, and desists for fear of saying too much.</p>

<p>"Two death-beds!" Mrs. Clendenon echoes. "Why, Allie
Winters was only taken ill last night, and you have been nursing
her ever since. Gracie, you don't mean to tell me that Allie
Winters is dead&mdash;so soon!"</p>

<p>"She died this evening with her arms about my neck," Grace
answers, in low, pained tones. "She had the fever in its worst
and most rapid form."</p>

<p>"Ah, me, that poor child! So young, so sweet, so beautiful,
and scarcely sixteen, I think. Was it not hard to be taken away
from this bright world so young?" sighed Mrs. Clendenon.</p>

<p>"Well, opinions may differ as to that," Mrs. Winans answers,
half bitterly. "The most fervent prayer I breathed over
her still form was one of thankfulness that she was taken perhaps
from 'evil to come.' She was the last of the family. They
have all died with the fever. She was poor, and almost
friendless&mdash;beautiful&mdash;and beauty is often the cause of poverty.
Had she lived her life must inevitably have been a sad one.
Better, perhaps, that she is at rest."</p>

<p>She pushes back her chair, folds her napkin, and makes a motion
to rise. Mrs. Clendenon remonstrates.</p>

<p>"Gracie, you have not taken a mouthful, child."</p>

<p>"No, but I have taken my cocoa. Andrew," sinking listlessly
back into her chair, and speaking to the white-aproned
waiter, "you may give me another cup."</p>

<p>"There seems to be no abatement of the fever?" she says, interrogatively,
to the captain, as she balances her spoon on the
edge of her cup.</p>

<p>"On the contrary," his grave face growing graver, "the number
of victims is daily augmented."</p>

<p>Her grieved sigh is echoed by Mrs. Clendenon's as they rise
from the table. The next moment a sharp rap sounds at the
door. Andrew opens it, admitting Doctor Constant himself&mdash;fine-looking,
noble, with the snows of sixty earnest winters on
his head and on the beautiful beard flowing over his breast&mdash;genial,
cheerful, gentle, as a physician should always be&mdash;he
makes a bow to our three friends, but declines to be seated
at all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span></p>

<p>"I have but a moment. I came out of my rounds to make
sure that Mrs. Winans does not go out to-night," and as an eager
remonstrance formed itself on her lip, he said, resolutely: "It
is no use; you must not think of going. It is imperative that
you should sleep. You are not more than half alive now."</p>

<p>"But, doctor, there are so many who need me," she says, with
a last endeavor to go.</p>

<p>"Others can take your place. We had new and fresh nurses
to come in to-day. Pardon me if I appear persistent, madam,
but I was your mother's family physician, and thoroughly understood
her condition. Your own resembles it in a high degree,
and I warn you that you have stood as much as you can without
rest. You are your own mistress, of course, and can do as you
please; but if you go to-night you are very apt to fall from exhaustion."</p>

<p>"Very well," she answers, wearily, as if not caring to contest
the point longer. "Since I do not wish to commit suicide, I
will stay at home and rest to-night."</p>

<p>"That is right. Your nervous system is disordered, and
needs recuperation. You will feel better to-morrow, and may
come back to the hospital. As for Mrs. Clendenon and the
captain, they may come back to-night."</p>

<p>She does not really know how tired she is until she goes up to
her room and throws herself on the lounge, face downward, like
a weary child, to rest. But, exhausted as she is, it is hours before
she sleeps. Nervous temperaments like hers are not heavy
sleepers. After long seasons of wakefulness she finds it almost
impossible to regain the habit of natural repose. Now she lies
quite still, every tense nerve quivering with weariness, but with
eyelids that seem forced open by some intangible power, and
busy, active brain that repeats all the exciting scenes of the past
week. When twelve o'clock sounds sharply on the still of the
night she rises, chilled and unrefreshed, and crouches over the
dying fire that has smoldered into ashes on the hearth long
since. She looks down at it vacantly, with a passing thought
that it is like her life, from which the sunshine and brightness
have faded long since, leaving only the chill whiteness of despair.
Often in still moments like these her young heart rises in half
angry bitterness, and beats against the bars of life, longing to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
be free. "Only half alive," Dr. Constant had said to her, and
patient and long-suffering as she was, I fear it had sent a half-thrill
of joy to her bosom. Life held so little for her, was so
full of repressed agony and pathos, pressed down its heavy
crosses so reluctantly on her fair young shoulders, and sometimes
even the love of God failed to fill up that empty heart
that hungered, as every human soul must, while bounded in
human frame, for human, mortal, tangible love. Resignation to
her fate she tried sedulously to cultivate, and succeeded generally.
Only in hours like this, when oppressed with a sense of
her great loneliness, the past rushed over her, with all its sweet
and bitter memories, and was put away from her thoughts with
uncontrollable rebellion against&mdash;<i>what</i> she scarcely dared speak,
since a higher power than mortal ruled the affairs of her destiny.</p>

<p>"God help me!" she murmured, as, pushing up a window-sash,
she leaned out and looked at the quiet city of Memphis
lying under the starry midnight sky, silent save for the occasional
rumble of wheels in the distance telling the watcher that
the work of death still went grimly on&mdash;the dead being hustled
out of the way to make room for the sick and dying.</p>

<p>The chilly night air, the cold white glimmer of the moon and
stars, cooled the feverish blood that throbbed in her temples, a
soft awe crept into her heart&mdash;the deep, all-pervading presence
of God's infinity; and as she shut down the window and went
back to the lounge, her pained, half-bitter retrospections were
overflowed by something of that "peace which passeth all understanding."</p>

<p>Sleep fell on her very softly&mdash;a deep, refreshing slumber&mdash;from
which only the morning sunshine aroused her. She rose
with renewed energy for her labor of love, and kept at her post
for weeks afterward, with only occasional seasons of rest and
sleep. Her superb organism kept her up through it all, aided
and abetted by her unfaltering will. Through it all there came
no tidings of her husband or child. Letters came often from
the absentees in Europe, but without mention of either, and
Grace began to feel herself a widow indeed.</p>

<p>The Clendenons, too, were indefatigable in their exertions for
the victims of the fever. They were always devoted and earnest
in their efforts, and kept a watchful care, too, over Grace, whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
zeal and willingness often outran her strength and power of
endurance.</p>

<p>Mrs. Clendenon's gentle, placid old face began to look many
months older, but it was in Willard that the greatest change
was perceptible. His cheerful spirit never flagged, but gradually
the two women who loved him each in her own way, began
to see that the tall, fine form grew thinner and slighter, the
face paler, and a trifle more serious, while silver threads began
to sprinkle themselves thickly in his dark hair. He was wearing
out his strong young manhood in hard, unremitting toil, and
leaving his constitution enfeebled and open to the attacks of
disease. The idolizing heart of his mother noted all this with
secret alarm, and she would fain have persuaded him to retire
from his arduous duties and return to Norfolk. His gentle but
firm refusal checked all allusion to the matter, and, as the weeks
wore away, and the fever began to lose its hold and abate its
virulence, she hoped that they would soon be released from their
wearing tasks, and allowed time for recuperation.</p>

<p>The contents of a letter received more than two months previous
from Lulu weighed also on Mrs. Clendenon's mind, and
she could not, as she often did in other matters, seek the sympathy
of Grace, as Lulu had desired she should not know anything
of it. So Mrs. Clendenon bore her burden of anxiety all
alone, save for Him who carries the half of all our burdens.</p>

"<span class="smcap">London, Eng.</span>, November 16th, 1873.<br />
</p>

<p>"Dear, dearest mother, whom I long so much to see that it
seems impossible to write you, sitting tamely here, all that is in
my heart, how can I express my grief and anxiety at hearing
that you are still in that terribly stricken city, and that there seems
no present prospect of the abatement of that awful epidemic?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
Oh, mother, how could you go&mdash;you, and brother Willie, and
Grace&mdash;all my dear ones&mdash;when you knew what anguish it must
cause me in my absence? I know that it is right&mdash;know that it
is a Christian's bounden duty to comfort the sick and afflicted,
and I honor you each in my whole heart for such noble, self-sacrificing
devotion as you are displaying. But oh, how my
heart is aching with the dread! Oh, mother, what if one of you
should be taken away? Oh, I cannot, cannot bear the thought!
And yet a strange <i>presentiment</i> weighs on me that on one or the
other of your dear faces I will never look again in this world.
Bruce, dear Bruce, who is so kind and loving to me, tells me
these are only homesick fancies. Aunt Conway persuades me
that I am only nervous and depressed, and that my fancies are
but the result of my feeble condition of health just now; but
am certain that it is more than all this. I pray that it may not
be, but my whole heart sinks with a sense of prophetic dread,
and if Bruce would only consent, I should at once return to the
United States and join you in Memphis; but neither he nor
Aunt Conway will listen to such a thing&mdash;their plans being
made to spend a portion of the winter in Italy, certainly&mdash;and
the chances are I shall not see you, my sweet mamma, until
spring, though how I shall survive our separation so long I cannot
tell. I miss you&mdash;oh, I miss you so much! and I have
wished for you so often! Even dear Bruce cannot make up to
me my loss in you.</p>

<p>"I suppose it is not necessary to describe all that I have seen
in this great city, as Brother Willie's letters from here were so
exhaustive and entertaining that they have left no new field of
description on which to waste my spare stock of adjectives.</p>

<p>"But, mother, I am so demure and quiet in my tastes that I
care very little for all the glories of the old world, and I pine to
go to you, and to be at home again, much to my dear husband's
chagrin, who is disappointed that I do not enter with more enthusiasm
into all the beauties of art and nature that we have
seen in our travels. Mrs. Conway applauds everything, but I
believe it is the fashion to do so&mdash;is it not? and <i>she</i> is <i>so</i> fashionable,
you know! I honestly appreciate all I see that is appreciable,
I think, but not with the keen pleasure of most travelers.
I am a home-bird, I suppose&mdash;one of the little timid brown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
birds that hop contentedly about the quiet garden paths, and
though having wings, do not care to fly.</p>

<span class="i0">"'The world of the affections is my world,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Not that of man's ambition.'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"Mother, do you remember when I wrote you from Brighton,
England, about the little child in whom I was so strangely interested?&mdash;whose
great resemblance to some one of whom I
could not think puzzled and interested me so? Well, I have
met again with the little darling here, and have visited his
grandparents at their elegant villa just outside the city&mdash;very old
people, I believe I wrote you they were&mdash;and devoted to this
child, who is, so I am told, the last of the race and name, which
has been in its time a very noble, as it is now, a very old one.
They are very wealthy and very proud people&mdash;the old baronet,
Sir Robert Willoughby, the haughtiest old aristocrat I ever met.
His wife, Lady Marguerite, is of a sweeter, gentler type, yet, I
fancy, very much in awe of her stern lord. Little Earle&mdash;the
heir of this great wealth and proud title&mdash;is one of the most interesting
little children I ever saw&mdash;wonderfully bright and intelligent.
He has taken a flattering liking to me, and is always,
when in my company, exerting his childish powers for my entertainment.
We visit quite frequently&mdash;"charming people," Aunt
Conway calls them. The little boy prattles to me, sometimes in
an incoherent sort of fashion, of his mother, who seems to be a
sort of faint, almost forgotten image in his baby mind. He is
not more than three or four years old&mdash;well grown for his age.
I have observed (Bruce, teasing fellow, says I have only fancied
it,) that they do not like to hear the little boy speak of his
mother. They never mention her themselves, and I have been
given to understand that she is dead, but they have never said
so in plain terms. The little one does not at all resemble his
grandparents.</p>

<p>"I commented casually on this to Lady Marguerite one day,
and she answered no, that, to her great regret, the child resembled
his father's family most, and she colored, and looked so
annoyed, that I felt sorry I had said so much, and tried to mend
the matter by saying that he had more the appearance of an
American child than an English one. She flushed even deeper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
than before, and said that she had never been in America, and
never to her knowledge seen an American child, but that Earle's
parents were in that country at the time of his birth, and remained
there some time after, which probably accounted for his
American look&mdash;she did not know. We said no more on the
subject, but the slight mystery that seemed to surround it made
me think of it all the more; and, mother, now I will tell you
why I have taken such an interest in the child. Aunt Conway
and Bruce jestingly declare me a monomaniac on this subject,
though they do not pretend to deny the fact of the likeness,
which struck me the very first time I saw him. Mother, this
little baronet that is to be, this little English child, with his long
line of proud ancestry, his haughty, blue-eyed grandparents, his
fragile, blue-eyed mother, whose picture I have seen in their
picture-gallery&mdash;this little dark-eyed boy is enough like Paul
and Grace Winans to be the <i>child they lost so strangely in Washington
two years ago</i>! He has the rarely beautiful dark eyes,
the dazzling smile of Senator Winans, the very features, expression,
peculiar gestures, and seraphic fairness of Grace. It
was a long time before this united likeness became clear to me.
Then it dawned on me like a flash of lightning, and now I am
continually reminded of dear Grace in the features and expressions
of this little child. It perplexes and worries me, although
Bruce assures me that it can only be one of those accidental
resemblances that we meet sometimes at opposite sides of
the world. Can this be so? It puzzles me, anyhow, and I
heartily wish that the missing Senator&mdash;or General Winans he
is now, you know&mdash;were here. I should certainly give him a
glimpse of little Earle Willoughby (he bears the name of his
grandparents by their wish), who is his living image, and then
we should 'see what we should see.' But it seems that the prevailing
belief in his death must be true for the papers now
speak of it as a settled fact, and give him the most honorable
mention. Poor, poor Grace! how my very heart bleeds at
thought of her bereavement, and her beautiful, unselfish devotion
to the cause of 'suffering, sad humanity.' Dear mother,
please do not mention to her what I have written about the
child. She cannot bear to have little Paul's name mentioned to
her, and no wonder, poor, suffering, brave heart! But, mother,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
darling, I mean to get at the bottom of the slight mystery that
enshrouds those people. If I discover anything worth writing
I will mention it in my next letter to you.</p>

<p>"Aunt Conway and Bruce join me in love to you all. My
warmest love to brother Willie and Grace, to both of whom I
shall shortly write. Be careful of your health, dearest mother,
I beg, and write early and often to your devoted daughter,</p>

<p>Captain Clendenon is taking an afternoon cigar.</p>

<p>He has stepped out of the hospital, where, thank God! there
are fewer patients and less need of him now, for a stroll in the
fresh air, and while he meanders down the principal thoroughfare,
he lights a Havana and enjoys his walk.</p>

<p>In financial panics one sees a crowded thoroughfare, with
people rushing hither and thither, and blockading the banks;
in pestilential panics one sees silent, deserted streets, and
dreary, deserted-looking buildings. This is all that meets Willard's
gaze as he stops on the corner, man-fashion, and looks idly
up and down at the occasional passers-by, for human faces are
the exception, not the rule. Now and then a man goes by, looks
hard at him, and nods respectfully. He is very well known here
as the noted Norfolk lawyer who has so nobly volunteered in the
cause of suffering humanity. Not a woman but looks twice at
the tall figure, with its fine military bearing, its handsome
head, set so grandly on its broad shoulders, its empty, pathetic
coat-sleeve pinned across the left breast.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span></p>

<p>Old death has been at work here. Those whom he has not
mowed down with his awful scythe have fled, terrified, beyond
his present harvest-field. There are places of business closed&mdash;some
of whose owners are abroad in other cities, others of whom
are holding commerce now with the worm and the grave. Here
and there a school-house is closed, the most of whose little
pupils have gone to learn of the angels. It is the dreariness of
desolation, and as he puffs meditatively away, these familiar
lines of Hemans come into his thoughts:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">"Leaves have their time to fall,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And flowers to wither at the north-wind's breath,<br /></span>
<span class="i7">And stars to set, but all,<br /></span>

<span class="i7">We know when moons shall wane,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">When summer birds from far shall cross the sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">When autumn's hue shall touch the golden grain&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i7">But who shall tell us when to look for thee?"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"A penny for your thoughts, Captain Clendenon," says a
fresh, young voice, and a small hand taps him on the shoulder.</p>

<p>He turns with a start. One of the dusky-eyed belles of Memphis,
with whom he has a casual acquaintance, has stopped to
chat with him&mdash;a tall, handsome young lady in a mannish costume
of navy-blue velvet, double-breasted English walking-jacket,
a mannish hat set jauntily on her black hair, and a set
of Grecian features, and large, black eyes.</p>

<p>His gray eyes light momentarily.</p>

<p>"Ah! Miss De Vere, this <i>is</i> a pleasure! About the thoughts&mdash;they
were not worth your inquiry."</p>

<p>"I am the best judge of that," and something in her tones,
not her careless words, imply that all his thoughts are precious
to her.</p>

<p>He tosses his cigar away, and turning, asks, politely:</p>

<p>"Are you out for a stroll? May I walk with you?"</p>

<p>"Am I out for a stroll? Yes, but on my way home now.
You may see me there with pleasure."</p>

<p>They walk on together down the quiet street, and her cheek
flushes a warmer red as she chatters softly to him, he rather
listening than talking. It is his way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span></p>

<p>"I thought you were out of the city&mdash;at the North," he says,
in answer to some remark. "Your father told me two months
ago he meant to take his family away from the pestilence."</p>

<p>"And so we were. We have but just gotten back since the
fever began to lose its hold. How brave you were to stay here!
Ugh!" she shuddered a little, "that terrible fever! Do you
know people say that you are a hero?"</p>

<p>"Do they?"</p>

<p>A low laugh ripples over his serene, finely cut lips. He wears
no beard, no mustache, and every flitting emotion shows itself
about his mobile mouth.</p>

<p>She sees a careless sort of surprise on his face now&mdash;nothing
more.</p>

<p>"Don't you care for it? It is so pleasant to be praised," she
says, in some wonder.</p>

<p>"I don't know&mdash;is it?"</p>

<p>"Is it not? Do you mean to say that you attach no value to
fame&mdash;fame that is won by good deeds?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," he answers again, in an absent way. "I
might have done it in my younger days&mdash;scarcely now. I like
to do good for its own sake&mdash;not for any praise that may follow
it."</p>

<p>"I know&mdash;I have heard at least," she stammered, with strange
timidity, "that you lost your arm to&mdash;to save another man's
life! Is it so, Captain Clendenon&mdash;did you give your arm for
his life?" her dusky eyes kindling with a passionate hero-worship,
that is characteristic of Southern women.</p>

<p>"Yes, I gave my arm for his life," he says, grimly. "I
might as well have given him my life, for when I buried my
left arm on the battle-field at Chancellorsville I buried with it
all the hopes that make a man's life worth the living."</p>

<p>"And why?" an unspoken sympathy on her pretty face.
"What hopes can there be that your misfortune can possibly
destroy?"</p>

<p>They turn a corner into a side street, where her home lies,
meeting a group coming toward them, a man with a bright-faced
wife clinging to one arm, a little laughing child by the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
hand, and two others following after. His glance marks them
out a moment, then meets hers, as he quotes, half-sadly:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'Domestic happiness! thou only bliss<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of Paradise that has survived the fall.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"Miss De Vere, cannot you suppose that a man getting into the
'sere and yellow leaf'&mdash;I am almost six-and-thirty years old&mdash;must
feel the need of some 'fair spirit for his minister?' And,"
his glance falling, hers following, on his empty sleeve, "what
woman could I ask to give herself to half a man?"</p>

<p>She slackens her pace to look up at him, in genuine honest
astonishment.</p>

<p>"Captain Clendenon, you have never been so quixotic, so absurdly
chivalrous as to think that any woman would not feel
honored to cast her lot with yours in spite of your honorable
misfortune&mdash;yes, if you had lost both your arms in the army as
nobly as you have lost one!"</p>

<p>"Thank you! thank you!" he answers, deeply moved, and
seeing the sudden waves of hot color breaking over the warm
Southern beauty of her face, he looks blindly away and thinks
what a noble-hearted girl she is, and how he has misjudged her
in thinking her a fine, fashionable flirt, as all along he had been
doing, when he thought of her at all, which was but seldom.</p>

<p>And then they are at the steps of the elegant De Vere
mansion, and she gently invites him to enter. He shakes his
head.</p>

<p>"I thank you; but I will continue my stroll. One gets so
little fresh air indoors, and I have been so confined lately. To-day
I am off duty, and making the most of it. My respects to
the family."</p>

<p>"Oh!" she says, turning, with her foot on the marble step.
"May I ask you one question?"</p>

<p>"A dozen, if you please," he returned, gallantly.</p>

<p>"It is only this: It is a current report here that the Hon.
Mrs. Winans, who came down here with your party to help
nurse the fever patients, is, or was, Miss Grace Grey of this
city&mdash;do you know if this is true?" lifting eager, inquiring eyes
to his face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, it is certainly true," and she sees some sort of a change
pass over his face&mdash;what, she cannot fathom.</p>

<p>"Indeed!" she says, in quick surprise and pleasure. "I knew
her intimately as a child; we were next-door neighbors"&mdash;she
nods at the handsome residence standing next to her own, and
he looks at it with tender interest&mdash;"and afterward we were in
boarding-school together. I always liked her so much. Will
you give her Stella De Vere's love, and tell her I will come and
see her if she will let me?"</p>

<p>"I certainly will, with pleasure," and they shake hands and
say good-by again, and she runs up the steps of her father's
stately home, pausing in the door-way as he turns away.</p>

<p>"He <i>is</i> a hero," she says, with a dreamy light in her dark eyes.
"How I <i>could love</i> him, if&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She shuts the door, half-sighing, and goes in.</p>

<p>For him, he walks away, stopping a moment in front of the
next-door house to light a fresh cigar, and glancing at the green
grounds, with their graveled paths, goes away with a fancy in
his mind of a fairy child with violet eyes and golden curls at
play beside the marble fountain under its dashing spray.</p>

<p>Grace Grey!</p>

<p>He walks on down the lonely street, his heart full of Grace
Grey, not Grace Winans; full of the child and girl whose light
steps have danced down this street in happier days&mdash;not the
Senator's sad-eyed wife&mdash;he has no right to think of <i>her</i>.
But this fairy, winning child, this innocent, joyous maiden,
who grows into shape and life in his loving imagination&mdash;she
is his own, his very own, to hold in his "heart of hearts,"
to think of, to idealize, to worship. He creates in his own
mind the goddess she was, goes back from the days
when he first knew her to those earlier days when Stella
De Vere knew her. Then an idle remembrance of Stella's
praise of him sets him thinking. Was it true? Would any
woman have loved him as well with his one arm as with two?
Would Grace have done it had he tried to win her? For a
moment a half-wish that he had tried, that he had won her
for his own idolized wife, overwhelmed him.</p>

<p>"She might have been quietly content with me," he thinks.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
"At least she should never have known the suffering, the passionate
pathos that darkens her young life now."</p>

<p>Too late! "Her place in his poor life is vacant for ever,"
and, as Grace has said once, he repeats:</p>

<p>"Fate is above us all."</p>

<p>He goes back to his visions of the child and maiden again;
his heart thrills with passionate fondness for the happy child,
the lovely girl whose dual lives have merged into the shadowed
life of beautiful Grace Winans. Fancies come and go, the
"light that never was on sea nor land" shining over his mild
pictures of what "might have been," and never opium-eater's
visions were fairer than the ideal dreams that go curling up in
the blue, fantastic smoke-wreaths of Captain Clendenon's cigar.</p>

<p>Sunset drives him to his hotel, chilled and thoughtful. The
winter sunshine, pleasant enough in this southern city, in its
declining, has left a chill in the air that seems to strike to his
heart. At the door he tosses away the remains of that magic
cigar and goes up to his room, where a cheerful fire throws its
genial warmth over everything, and brings out the stale odor
of cigar smoke that clings to him. He throws off his coat, and
in his white shirt-sleeves, pours fresh water from the pitcher
into the basin.</p>

<p>"Phew!" he says, in disgust, "how smoky I am!" pushing
back his neat linen cuff and bending over, in manly fashion, to
dip head and hand into the water; he gives a slight cough,
then, gasping, bends lower, while a crimson stream flows fast
from his lips into the crystal water, turning it all to blood.</p>

<p>Again and again that slight cough, again and again that warm
tide flowing from his lips&mdash;and yet he seems not in the least
surprised, not in the least alarmed, only steadies himself, with
his hand pressed on the edge of the wash-stand, and watches
the flowing life-stream, his face growing white as marble.</p>

<p>Then the stream thins, grows less and less, and less, and
gradually ceases. Taking up a glass of fresh water he rinses his
mouth of the blood, and standing, looking down at the scarlet
flood in the wash-basin, says thoughtfully, but not fearfully:</p>

<p>"This is the second time I have done it. I think I will see
Dr. Constant to-morrow."</p>

<p>A tap at the door.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span></p>

<p>"Mother must not <i>know</i>," he says, and hurriedly laying a
large towel over the wash-basin, is sitting comfortably in front
of his fire when he calls out:</p>

<p>"Come in."</p>

<p>It is Mrs. Clendenon, just come in from the hospital, her gentle
face flushed from walking, a placid smile on her lip.</p>

<p>"Willard, are you here? Gracie and I have but just come
in and missed you&mdash;why, how pale you are&mdash;are you sick?"</p>

<p>"No, not sick. I have but just come in also. I was out
walking and came in chilled&mdash;have not thawed out yet."</p>

<p>"Oh, Willard, my boy!" she cries, in a horrified tone, "what
is that?"</p>

<p>A great spat of blood he had not observed stained his spotless
linen cuff; she turned dead white as she saw it.</p>

<p>"It is nothing," he answers, with his handkerchief at his lips,
but he draws it away dashed with minute streaks of blood; "sit
down, mother, dear, don't get nervous, don't get excited."</p>

<p>She is leaning over his chair, her arm around his shoulder,
her eyes full of piteous mother's love and fear fixed on his pale
face.</p>

<p>"My son, what does it mean?"</p>

<p>"Mother, nothing much. I have only had a slight hemorrhage
from the lungs&mdash;from over-exertion, I presume. It is
all over now; but to make all sure I will consult Doctor Constant
to-morrow, and I will be more careful of my health and strength
hereafter, I promise you."</p>

<p>"Oh, I knew you were killing yourself," she wailed; "I
knew it!"</p>

<p>"Don't, mother&mdash;don't talk so wildly. It was for the best, I
assure you; it had to come. I shall be very much better after
this; Doctor Constant will tell you so," he says, tenderly, to the
wild-eyed mother, who is white with fear for her boy, and with
all a woman's physical horror at the sight of blood.</p>

<p>She glances around her vacantly, then suddenly walks across
the room, lifting the towel from the wash-basin. She looks with
reeling brain and dazed eyes on that scarlet tide, and turns on
her son a look of awful horror and anguish&mdash;such anguish as a
mother's heart can feel&mdash;down, down, down in its fathomless,
illimitable depths. He comes forth and steadies her reeling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
form with his one arm about her waist, looking down at
her with those earnest, beautiful gray eyes.</p>

<p>"Oh, mother, don't look so&mdash;don't grieve so! I tell you, certainly,
I shall be better after this. I have only lost a little
blood. Cheer up, little mother. Doctor Constant shall give
me a tonic, and make it all right. You won't tell Mrs. Winans?
I would rather she did not know. She would worry over it,
too, and there is nothing to alarm either of your tender hearts."</p>

<p>He did get better of it, though Doctor Constant shook his
head warningly when he met him still at his labors in the hospital.
Grace knew nothing of it, by his wish, and in February
a letter from Lulu, who had spent a portion of the winter in
Italy, filled Mrs. Clendenon with the same perplexities, doubts,
and hopes that agitated Lulu's heart in her far away home in
London, which, with its foggy atmosphere and chilly rains,
made itself peculiarly disagreeable to the young American
lady who pined for the clear, pure atmosphere and health-giving
sea-breeze of her own native home, while she gently deferred
to the wishes of her husband and his aunt, and remained
abroad until it pleased them to turn their faces homeward.</p>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">London, Eng.</span>, March 20th, 1874.<br />
</p>

<p>"I promised to write you, dear mother if I should discover
anything of interest relating to the little child of whom I wrote
you in the autumn; and thanks to dear Bruce (who pretended
not to take any interest in the matter at all) I have something
to write you which, if nothing more comes of it, is certainly one
of the strangest coincidences that ever happened. Mrs. Conway
and Bruce think it can be only a coincidence, but my hopeful
heart whispers that it may be more. But I will tell you of it,
mother dearest, and leave you to judge for yourself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span></p>

<p>"In the first place, then, my dear Bruce used only to be
amused at my fondness for and interest in the child that bore
such marked resemblance to two of my friends, though he could
not but admit the likeness himself. But after he became convinced,
as I was, that there was some mystery or some secret
about the little one's parentage, he, quite unknown to me (not
wishing to arouse hopes that might be disappointed in the end),
set about making inquiries in a quiet and cautious manner,
which brought to light the facts I am about to relate.</p>

<p>"I suppose it is hardly necessary I should remind you,
mother, that the Englishwoman, Mrs. Moreland, who stole little
Paul Winans from the hotel in Washington, D. C., and was
traced to the steamer that left for England, told the servant-girl
there that she had buried her husband in New York, as also
a little girl and boy one year old, and that he was the last child
of five. You will also remember that the girl, Annie Grady, and
other waiters in the hotel thought that Mrs. Moreland was not
quite right in her mind&mdash;that is to say, she was on the verge of
insanity, and it was supposed that, under some hallucination
that the child was her own, she kidnapped little Paul, and, with
a lunatic's proverbial cunning, succeeded in getting away with
him.</p>

<p>"Now, mother, this is what Bruce has discovered. First,
that Sir Robert and Lady Marguerite Willoughby never had but
one child, a fair and gentle young daughter, who mortally
offended them by eloping with and marrying her drawing-master,
a young man with the beauty of a Greek god and the humble station
and sheer poverty which is too often the birthright of such
beauty. For this offense she was disinherited and exiled forever
from the presence of her haughty patrician father. It is
said that the gentle mother would gladly have forgiven the erring
child and made the best of the <i>mesalliance</i>, but Sir Robert's
will being law, she had no choice but to abide by it. Secondly,
that the disinherited daughter and her poor and handsome husband
led a precarious existence in London for ten years, during
which time four children were successively born to them and
died; all this time the cruel parents of the willful daughter
refusing her appeal for forgiveness. At the death of the last
child the unfortunate but devoted pair concluded to try their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
fortune in America, whither they accordingly went, settling in
New York. There another child was born to them, and fortune,
long unpropitious, began to smile on the loving pair, when the
sudden death of the husband left the timid young mother a
widow and a stranger, with a fatherless child. The shock nearly
unsettled her reason, and she waited only for the burial of her
husband before she started for England with her baby, and on
reaching here, presented herself, homeless, friendless, almost
destitute, before her cruel parents, with an ill and fretful babe
in her arms. They would have been inhuman to have turned
her away. She was taken back to their home and hearts, but
too late, for she was barely sane enough to give an incoherent
account of her husband's death in America before her melancholy
madness reached such a violent stage that they were compelled
to remove her to a lunatic asylum, where she still
remains, a hopeless maniac.</p>

<p>"The child, whose dark beauty and lack of resemblance to
his mother's family they attributed to a perfect likeness of its
deceased father, they received into their home and hearts, and
formally adopted as their own, since they two, being really the
last of his race, this child was the only one left to perpetuate
the name and title of the proud Willoughbys. Remorse for the
part they acted to their unhappy daughter leads them to preserve
entire silence as to her and the sad story I have been telling
you. All this Bruce learned from one who is intimate with
the family, and, indeed, the story is well known in London,
though they never mention it to strangers. But her parents, of
course, knowing of her life while in New York, have not the
slightest doubt of the little boy being their grandchild, the son
of their daughter, Christine, and her husband, Earle Moreland.
You will remember, mother, that the kidnapper of Grace's little
son was registered at the Washington hotel as Mrs. Earle Moreland.
I think we only need to prove that Mrs. Moreland's child
died in New York to claim this little child of Grace. But I
leave you to draw all inferences, dear mother, and I know that
you will agree with me that there is more than coincidence in
the case.</p>

<p>"All that I have told you Bruce discovered before we went to
Italy. Now that we have returned he intends to push the matter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
further and try to get at the truth of the whole affair. I do
not yet know what steps he will take in the matter, but pray
with me, my own beloved mother, that 'the truth may be made
manifest,' and that dear, patient Grace may have her child
restored to her, for I feel certain that this darling little boy, of
whom we are all so fond, is her own child. And, oh! what a
pleasure it will be to me to see him restored to her by any
instrumentality of mine.</p>

<p>"Still I think it best to keep her in ignorance of all this yet
awhile; for uncertainty and suspense on this subject now would
be, I know, more than she could bear; and, besides, we cannot
yet know what the end may be. I will send you further
tidings as soon as we have any. You can tell brother Willie of
it all. His clear, prudent judgment may be of use to us, but
he is not to let Grace know.</p>

<p>"I am almost counting the days, mother, between this and
the happy day that shall bring me to your dear, loving arms
again! I miss you <i>so</i> much, and brother Willie, and dear
Gracie, too.</p>

<p>"I had intended to tell you of my pleasant time at Lady
T&mdash;&mdash;'s reception, my dining at the embassy, and many other
interesting things, which I will have to postpone until my next,
as my husband is now waiting to take me for a drive, and I, as
of old, dear mother, am so fond of driving. How I used to like
dear Grace's little phaeton!</p>

<p>"Bruce and Aunt Conway both join me in love to all, and
both are well, but beginning, I believe, like myself, to feel a
little homesick.</p>

<p>"My warmest love to dear Gracie and my darling brother
Willie, and, mother, dear, do, do, all of you, take care of your
health, and don't kill yourselves in that awful Memphis, and do
not fail to write at earliest convenience to your</p>

<p>To Captain Clendenon, who lay tossing on the bed of sickness
his mother had long foreboded, the news that Lulu's letter
brought was cheering in the highest degree. His clear judgment
brought him to the same conclusion as his sister, and had
he been well he would have instantly started for New York to
take up the missing links in the old quest for the lost child of
Grace. But just as the fever epidemic had come to an end,
and the three jaded nurses were thinking of a return to Norfolk,
the weakness that had been growing on him for months
culminated in an attack of typhoid fever, that dire enemy of an
enfeebled system. He had lain for two weeks now consumed
with fever, tortured with pain, and inwardly chafing because
the two patient women, who had thought their labors for the
sick ended for the season, were now indefatigably devoted to
the task of lightening, as far as mortal power could do, his intense
suffering.</p>

<p>Doctor Constant came and went with the last days of March,
going out always with a look that Mrs. Clendenon and Grace&mdash;who
had learned to read his countenance&mdash;felt almost hopeless
at seeing. Weeks passed, and the strange fever that seemed
playing "fast and loose" with the patient&mdash;that rises and falls,
but never goes&mdash;kept its fiery hold on its victim. His mother
was always by his side, mixing medicines, pouring cooling
drinks, watching and noting every fluctuation of the disease
with the grave, sad patience we often note in elderly women<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
who have grown so used to affliction that they bear it with a
fortitude impossible to younger women like Grace, who fretted
and chafed and grieved at the slow disease that held her friend
in its tenacious grasp. Yet she was only second in her exertions
for him to the mother. It was her small, soft hand that bathed the
burning forehead in sprinkling ice-water and pungent perfume;
her hand that fluttered the grateful palm-leaf fan that kept such
fresh and pure air around the bedside; her hand that was always
ready and willing to undertake anything that promised relief,
or even alleviation; her presence that lent sunshine to the
darkened chamber, where the angels of life and death were
striving for Willard Clendenon's soul.</p>

<p>Pretty Stella De Vere, hearing of his illness, called often to
inquire about him, and sent daily gifts of hot-house flowers and
fruits to tempt the delicate appetite, and in the solitude of her
own soul knew that a dear, dear hope was fading from her life
forever.</p>

<p>Sometimes, when the hot, delirious fever fell, and reason held
her throne against the enemy, the young man's heart ached at
the sight of the pale, worn faces that always wore a cheerful
smile for his waking hours. In the contest that was waging he
felt very sure which would come off conqueror; but with the
fortitude which had marked his life, he kept his opinions to
himself, unwilling to grieve his mother and Grace, and unwilling
to hasten Lulu's return on account of the investigation she was
pursuing, much as he longed to see her. One unsatisfied wish
troubled his feverish hours, and lent a wistful light to his eyes
that Grace could not bear to see. Had it pleased God to restore
his health, he would have liked to have gone to London
and have brought back her child to her, that he might have had
the pleasure of reviving hope in her desolate heart. Still it was
a comfort to know that it would almost certainly be brought
back to her some time. With this thought he must content
himself, and he did as well as he was able.</p>

<p>"I am wearing you both out," he said, sadly, one day, to the
two who were trying to hide beneath cheerful smiles the heart-ache
which a recent visit from Doctor Constant had left, his
grave face showing his opinion too plainly. "This long illness,
after all you have endured, is unpardonable in me. Mother,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
why not have a nurse for me, and allow yourself and Mrs.
Winans some rest?"</p>

<p>The trembling hand of the gray-haired mother fluttered down
like a blessing on the burning brow of her eldest-born&mdash;the
son who had always been a blessing to her from the hour
when his baby lips stirred the mother-love into life within her
breast until now, when the hand that had smoothed her widowed
path so gently, lay still and wasted on the counterpane,
never to take up life's burden again.</p>

<p>"Always unselfish," she answered, in faltering tones. "No,
Willie, dear boy, I cannot delegate to others the dear task of
soothing your hours of pain."</p>

<p>"Nor can I," supplemented Grace, laying an impulsive,
clasping hand on the thin one that rested outside the counterpane.
"I have put myself in Lulu's place, and it is as a sister
that I claim the privilege of waiting on you."</p>

<p>"Thanks," he answered, deeply moved, and Mrs. Clendenon,
with an irrepressible sob, went gliding from the room.</p>

<p>"Oh, about Lulu," she says, with assumed carelessness to
hide her real feelings. "Why is it you won't consent to have
your mother send for her to come on while you are so sick?
Don't you want to see her?"</p>

<p>"Don't I?" a wistful pain in his dark eyes. "Dear little
sister Lulu, how I long to see her I cannot tell you! But why
hasten her? She is coming shortly anyhow. She may be in
time to see me; if not, we still shall meet again some time. She
will come to me."</p>

<p>"Don't talk that way," she says, in distress and pain. "You
will get better as soon as this fever breaks."</p>

<p>"Or worse," he amends. "You know a crisis must come
then, Mrs. Winans, whether for better or worse, we cannot now
tell. But we all know&mdash;you, mother, and the doctor, though
you try to hide it from me&mdash;that the indications point to the
worst. Yesterday, I had slight hemorrhage from the lungs
again."</p>

<p>"Don't talk so," she pleads again. "How can any of us&mdash;the
doctor, even&mdash;tell what will be the result of the crisis?
We hope for the best. Do you not remember how ill I was in
Washington with brain fever, and how Lulu would not let them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
shave off my long curls? No one thought I would recover, yet
I did. So, I trust, will you."</p>

<p>"Yes, if it so please God; but I think, Mrs. Winans, that He
is going to be very merciful, and take me to Himself."</p>

<p>"Going to be very merciful," she repeats, with a grave wonder
in her large eyes, as at something new and strange. She
cannot at all understand how this quiet heart that has always
seemed to her so untouched by any great joy or grief, can be so
eagerly content in going "home." "Why, you do not want to
die so young. The world needs good men like you so much
that God will not take you yet! Why, what can you mean?"</p>

<p>"Just this, Mrs. Winans," he lifts his honest gray eyes to her
fair face&mdash;his fever is falling, and he seems quite cool, though
earnest&mdash;"that God, when he puts a life-long sorrow on our
hearts, usually compensates for it by giving us a brief span in
which to endure it. Sorrow like yours, that may be turned
into joys again, He lets us live to bear. Crosses like mine, that
may be blessing, but never joy, He lets one lay down early at
the foot of the Great White Throne."</p>

<p>Sweeping lashes shade her cheeks to hide her great surprise.
She asks nothing of Captain Clendenon's cross, though till now
she has never dreamed of its existence.</p>

<p>"Some lost love," she guesses, with ready sympathy in her
heart, and answers, sadly:</p>

<p>"Sorrows like mine can never turn into joys, <i>mon ami</i>."</p>

<p>"They can, they will," he cries, in glad excitement. "I
know, I feel, that one of your lost ones, at least, will be restored
to you."</p>

<p>"Oh! what can you mean?"</p>

<p>In eager hope she rises, looking down at him with eyes that
would fain read the secret he had almost betrayed.</p>

<p>"Sit down," he answers, in calmer tones, "and forgive me for
startling you so. I only meant that I felt like this, dear friend;
and I do feel as if the shadows are passing from your life, and
that, ere long, all will be well with you. It is given sometimes,
you know, to dying eyes to see very clearly."</p>

<p>A flashing drop from her blue eyes falls down upon the hand
that still lies under the soft clasp of hers, and in low tones she
answers:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span></p>

<p>"Hush, now, you had better not talk any more. I fear you
will overtask your strength. I am going to read some for
you."</p>

<p>And closing his eyes he listens peacefully to the sweet, tremulous
voice that reads the fourteenth chapter of St. John, beginning:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Let not your heart be troubled."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And thus the days pass by, each one stealing a hope from the
watcher's heart, and so many hours from Willard's life. Their
patience does not waver, nor does his quiet courage. He knows
that the world is fair outside, that the Southern sky is blue and
bright&mdash;that flowers are blossoming, that birds are singing&mdash;knows,
too, that all "Creation's deep musical chorus, unintermitting,
goes up into Heaven," and is fain to go with it. Very
bravely and contentedly he breasts the dark waters, knowing
that a strong arm upholds him, even His who said to the ocean's
tumult:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Peace, be still!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Mrs. Clendenon has written to Lulu that he is ill, but ere that
long delayed letter reaches her his wasted frame may perchance
"be out of pain, his soul be out of prison;" for it is the last of
March now, and Doctor Constant and his consulting physicians
think that the fever is almost broken, and the crisis near at
hand. What the result will be they almost certainly know, but
still whisper feeble hope to the agonized heart of the mother,
whose yearning prayer goes up to God that He will spare her
first-born.</p>

<p>He does not always answer such prayers in the way that seems
good to us. But all the same, He who is Maker of all things,
Judge of all things, judges best for us poor finite reasoners.</p>

</div></div>

<p>"Why? ah, why?" The answer to such queries we shall find

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span></p>

<p>Closer and closer yet grew the fond tie between mother and
son as the long days waned to the lovely Southern twilight.
Many gentle conversations blessed the absent sister from whom
another letter came on the third of April, to say that no letters
from home had reached her for a month; so she was still ignorant
of that fatal illness her tender heart had foreboded
mouths before. One portion of the letter which she specially
desired her brother to read, he was too ill to see for several days
after its reception. Not until after that night at whose eve
Doctor Constant said sadly to his mother:</p>

<p>"The fever is gone. It will be decided to-night. We shall
know in the morning."</p>

<p>And the grave-yard twilight brightened into starry night&mdash;the
softest, balmiest Southern night&mdash;and three watched by the bedside,
for Doctor Constant came, too, to share that vigil, in the
strong, friendly love he felt for the man who had worked so
bravely for the death-stricken in that doomed city. Hand in
hand Gracie and the mother watched, each torn with the agony
of dread, for Grace had taken him into her deep heart as a dear
and faithful brother, and felt that one more pleasure would be
buried for her in Willard Clendenon's early grave.</p>

<p>So the hours wore on; the mystic midnight came&mdash;passed&mdash;and
in the morning they <i>knew</i>.</p>

<p>"It is the will of God," Doctor Constant said, holding the
weeping mother's hand fast in his, and speaking in the strong
assurance and resignation of a Christian faith. "He is wise and
just, and knows the right better than you or I, dear friend. Be
strong, for the end is near; the angels will come for him at
sunset."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"Willard, dear son, there is a letter from your sister that she
wished you to read. Are your eyes strong enough, or shall I
read it for you?"</p>

<p>Lying back among his pillows, as white as they, very much
wasted, with the dark curls waving back from the high, pale
brow, and a very quiet peace in his grave, sweet eyes, Willard
takes that letter, and reads it, slowly and painfully through.</p>

<p>A dimness crosses his vision as he holds it more than once,
and a remembrance comes to him as he notes the clear, running<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
chirography, of how his own hand once guided the little fingers
that traced these lines in their first labored efforts to write. But
the light of a very sweet content irradiates his face as he turns
its pages. If there is aught that can heighten the content of
these, his dying hours, it is the story that is told in the pages of
his sister's letter&mdash;the fair and tenderly loved young sister whom
he will see no more until, as redeemed souls, they clasp each
other on the sunny shores that are laved by the surf rolling up
from the shadowless river.</p>

<p>"Such a joyful thing has happened, dear mother, that I could
scarcely believe my own ears when (now more than two weeks
ago) Bruce came in and told me General Winans was in London,
not dead at all, and only just returned from France, where
he had remained until thoroughly cured of the wound which
had left him for dead on the dreadful battle-field. It seems
that he was removed from the field by a poor and devoted young
French soldier, a private in the ranks, and carried to a secure
though humble place, where he was attended by a skillful old
Frenchwoman who dressed his wounds with real surgical skill,
and took care of him through a long period of convalescence, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
having two protracted relapses and nearly losing his life, sure
enough. The reason he was so carefully concealed by the old
woman and her nephew, was through fear of the Germans, as
the war ended with that battle, you remember, and the conquerors
had things all their own way. When quite recovered he
rewarded the kind couple and left for London, and had been
here but two days when Bruce met him quite accidentally on
the street. You remember his old feud with Bruce, dear
mother?</p>

<p>"Well, my dear husband tells me that he drew up his fine,
princely figure, and would have passed him without recognition
had not Bruce, with a resolution quite foreign to his easy
nature, absolutely button-holed the proud fellow, and told him,
all in a breath, about his marriage and his bridal-tour, and
invited him to see Aunt Conway and me at our hotel. Of
course, in view of Bruce's being married, he forgave him all he
at present held against him, and came, nothing loth, to see us,
and was so delighted&mdash;not more than I, though, I will admit.
We kept him all the evening, and heard from his own lips the
romantic story of his joining and fighting in the army of
France, and of his rescue from death by the young French
private. I used to be half afraid of him, but now I think,
mother, he is the most fascinating and admirable gentleman I
ever met&mdash;you know such an odor of romance and adventure
clings about him.</p>

<p>"He had a perfect torrent of questions to ask me about Grace.
All of them I answered to the best of my ability, but I was not,
I confess, prepared for his great agony when I told him she was
at Memphis, nursing the fever patients there. Mother, I never
saw a human being turn so pallid as he did. He sat quite still
for a while, his hand pressed to his brow, and only once I heard
a sort of moan from his lips, that sounded like, 'Oh, Grace, you
have indeed avenged yourself!' I hastened to assure him that
the fever had abated, and the nurses were all returning to their
homes, and I expected Grace, as also you and brother Willie,
would soon return to Norfolk. And, mother, I felt so sorry for
him that I at once blurted out the story of the little boy, Earle
Willoughby. Oh, such happy, incredulous excitement I never
saw in any one before. Bruce had to tell it all over to him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
I was both laughing and crying during my relation of it&mdash;'silly
child!' as Aunt Conway says. Well, he and Bruce entered at
once upon an investigation that has resulted in restoring hope
and happiness to two that I love, and in making warm friends
and allies of those two men who once stood up on Norfolk's outskirts
to try to murder each other, with fiery hatred in their
hearts.</p>

<p>"But time has changed all that. My Bruce is a better man
to-day than he was then, and General Winans is reasonable, less
fiery, less causelessly jealous. Painful experience has taught
both of them wisdom.</p>

<p>"Oh, mother, it is all as I expected. I am so happy in the
happiness that is to come to our beautiful Grace; my whole
heart throbs with such joyous emotion,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'I could laugh out as children laugh<br /></span>
<span class="i5">Upon the hills at play.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"General Winans and Bruce lost no time in calling on the
Willoughbys to acquaint them with their suspicions. They
found them away from home. Investigation disclosed the fact
that they had been summoned to the mad-house of which their
daughter, poor Christine Moreland, was an inmate. She was
very ill, and, as I am told many lunatics do, recovered sense
and reason when the cold hand of death was laid upon her. She
sent for her parents to confess the crime, the full knowledge
and remembrance of which first rushed upon her in that hour.
Bruce and General Winans followed them at once to the asylum,
which was an elegant and private one in high repute.
They had no need to tell their story. Sir Robert and Lady Marguerite
knew all, were in possession of all proofs, and in all their
desolation gave back the child, without an objection, to its
rejoicing father. He has his own again, and lacks but Grace's
presence and forgiveness to make him the happiest man in the
world.</p>

<p>"But, mother, there seems some reactionary power in the laws
of this world that makes the sorrows of some the prices of
others' happiness. The grief of that lonely old pair, so suddenly
despoiled of all they looked on as kindred to them is
something mournfully pathetic. Old, and sad, and worn, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
they looked, bending over the costly casket that held poor little
Mrs. Moreland, at the imposing funeral, I shall never cease to
compassionate them. Little Paul, or Earle, as he will continue
to be called, and his father, are their guests now, as they cannot
bear to give up the little boy until the last moment. But Sir
Robert, in his attachment to his little adopted son, intends
making him his sole heir, since the property is not entailed, and
there is no kin. General Winans has promised&mdash;with the proviso
of his wife's consent&mdash;that his son shall always bear the
name of Earle Willoughby Winans. General Winans has
promised to visit them this summer again, bringing his wife,
if she will come. Gracie, you know, mother, has never been
abroad, and General Winans wants to bring her over here for an
extended tour.</p>

<p>"How my pen has run on jumbling up statements in happy,
inextricable confusion! But, mother, you must all be at home
in May, for in May we shall all be with you once again&mdash;oh,
joyful thought!</p>

<p>"But, mother, Gracie, dear, patient, long-suffering darling,
is not to know anything about the child until we come home.
General Winans wishes it. He wants to bring her the joyful
tidings in his arms, and who can blame him? Mrs. Conway
thinks it perfectly natural and right, so does Bruce, so do I&mdash;and
do not you think so, too, dear mother?</p>

<p>"The rest of the story&mdash;about General Winans being alive,
and coming home so soon&mdash;I want her to know. And, mother,
I would like brother Willard to tell her of it. He will take such
pleasure in it! was always so fond of her, so desirous of her happiness,
that I want the good news to come to her from his lips,
because I think he would like it to be so.</p>

<p>"Dear, dear brother Willie! Mother, I think sometimes that
he is not as happy as the rest of us. He has never said so&mdash;it
may be only my fancy&mdash;but my heart holds always such a great,
unutterable tenderness for him, and a sort of sacred reverence,
as for some unspoken grief of his. How happy I am that, God
willing, I shall soon be folded again to his dear, loving heart!</p>

<p>"Mother, do try to induce Gracie to take proper rest and
sleep, so as to regain her bright looks before we got home. She
is never less than lovely, but I want her to be at her best for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
eyes of her husband. For, mother, I do like him so much&mdash;indeed,
he is a fine, frank, noble follow, one whom you will like, I
know. And he and Bruce are quite good friends, so that there
will be no more envyings, jealousies, and such like, but the
brooding dove of peace over our hearts and homes, I trust,
forever.</p>

<p>"I am so happy at thought of seeing you all again, and at all
that has happened, that I am too nervous, too glad, or too something,
to write more. Aunt Conway, looking over my shoulder
at this, says it is hysterical. I am not sure it is not; so,
mother, dear, try to evolve order out of this confused chaos of facts,
and we will tell the story more lengthily and intelligibly when
we all get home, which, thank Heaven, will be very soon. I
have had no letter from you for a month. Why is it?</p>

<p>"With tendered regards to all, I am your devoted daughter,</p>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">Lulu C. Conway</span>.<br />
</p>

<p>"P. S.&mdash;General Winans would write to Grace, but fears repulse
in spite of my assurances to the contrary. He tells me
he must ask pardon only on his knees for the irreparable suffering
he has caused her gentle spirit. Perhaps he is right&mdash;I cannot
tell. Once more with fondest love, <i>au revoir</i>.</p>

<p>"Grace, love, will you go to Willard? He has something to
say to you."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span></p>

<p>The southern sun hung low in the western heavens; the day
was excessively warm for April, and a little cloud in the sky,
"no bigger than a man's hand," foreboded a shower. Grace
turned from the window where she stood watching the shifting
white clouds in the blue sky, and went back to the room from
which she had stolen to hide the bitter pain at her heart.</p>

<p>A very solemn silence hung about the white-draped chamber.
The window shutters were open to admit the balmy air, and a
slanting ray of sunshine had stolen in and brightened the top of
the sick man's pillow, touching into golden radiance the dark
locks pushed away from his brow. The wan and wasted face
wore a beautiful serenity that was not of earth. "God's finger"
had "touched him" very gently, but palpably.</p>

<p>Grace bent over him, taking his cold white hand in hers with
voiceless emotion. She had grown so fond of him in a warm,
sisterly fashion, reverenced his brave, pure, upright spirit so
highly that it seemed to her a close and kindred soul was winging
its way from her side to the bright beyond, leaving her more
alone and desolate than ever.</p>

<p>"It is almost over," he said, looking up at her with the reflex
of a smile in the beautiful dark-gray orbs that kept their luminous
radiance to the last.</p>

<p>She answers not. How can she break with the sounds of
human grief the brooding peace that shines on the pathway of
this departing spirit? Her voice, the sweetest one he will ever
hear on this side of eternity, rises low but firm in one of the old-fashioned
hymns the old-fashioned captain loved:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Fear not, I am with thee. O be not dismay'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">I, I am thy God, and will still give thee aid;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">I'll strengthen thee, help thee, and cause thee to stand,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Upheld by my righteous, omnipotent hand.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"When through the deep waters I call thee to go,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The rivers of grief shall not thee overflow;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">For I will be with thee thy troubles to bless,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And sanctify to thee thy deepest distress."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"Amen," he whispers, lowly. "His rod and His staff they
comfort me."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span></p>

<p>Silence falls for a brief space. He is gathering his fainting
strength for the words that come slowly from his lips:</p>

<p>"I have been the bearer to you of unwelcome tidings so often,
Mrs. Winans, that it absolutely pains me now to recall it."</p>

<p>"Do not recall it," she rejoins, earnestly. "Why should
you? The power overruling such things is higher than we are.
You have been a comforter to me more often than you know of&mdash;take
only that thought with you."</p>

<p>He smiles as she re-arranges his pillows, lifting his head so
that his faint breath comes more evenly. The stray end of one
of her long silken curls falls over his breast an instant, and he
touches it with a caressing hand.</p>

<p>"It is given to me," he answers, "to bear you good tidings
before I go. Your memories of me&mdash;will not thus be all unpleasant
ones."</p>

<p>The eager remonstrance forming itself on her lip dies unspoken
as he goes on:</p>

<p>"You have borne sorrow with a very brave heart, Gracie&mdash;have
been, as you once told me, and as I really think, <i>fireproof</i>!
Can you bear joy as well?"</p>

<p>She cannot possibly speak. Something rising in her throat
literally chokes her breath.</p>

<p>"Little sister, be strong. Lulu has written&mdash;well, that your
husband&mdash;that Winans is in London, alive and well&mdash;and is
coming home to you&mdash;in May."</p>

<p>There is utter silence. She is quiet always, in pain or pleasure.
He sees only her small hands clasping each other close,
and her violet eyes&mdash;those unerring indices of her feelings&mdash;growing
dusk black under the lashes. But something in the
curve of her firm lip does not satisfy him. He feebly lifts his
hand to touch hers.</p>

<p>"You will not be hard and unforgiving? It is not like Grace
Winans to be that. Promise me that you will forgive him
freely! If he acted wrongly he has suffered for it. It is so easy
to go wrong&mdash;to err is human, you know."</p>

<p>No wavering in that sternly curved red lip shows acquiescence.
His voice rises higher, with a throb of pain in it:</p>

<p>"'If ye forgive not men their trespasses how shall my Father
which is in heaven forgive you?' Gracie, say 'I promise.'"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span></p>

<p>All the sudden hot anger against the husband she had loved&mdash;the
husband who had wronged her, and left desolate the
sweetest years of her life&mdash;fades out of her heart. The words
falter as hollowly from her lips as from his:</p>

<p>"I promise."</p>

<p>"Thanks. May God bless you&mdash;and&mdash;and make all your
future years happy ones. Mother&mdash;call mother, please."</p>

<p>She puts a little cordial to the panting lips and tearfully
obeys.</p>

<p>On her knees at the other side of the bed the anguished
mother listens to the tender message to the absent sister, the
soft words of comfort, the low farewell. With the last kiss of
her son on her lips she buries her face speechlessly in his
pillow.</p>

<p>"Gracie, will <i>you</i> raise me a little?"</p>

<p>She bends with one arm under his shoulders, the other across
his breast, and lifts him so that his head rests comfortably
against her shoulder&mdash;an easy task, fragile and wearied as she is,
for he has wasted in the grasp of that destroying fever until he
is scarcely more than a wan shadow of himself.</p>

<p>Bending to look into his face, she asks, softly:</p>

<p>"Willard, are you easy now?"</p>

<p>"Quite <i>easy</i>," he answers, in a strangely contented tone, with
such a tender caress in it that Grace starts; and as he falters
"good-by," she bends with a sudden impulse and just touches
her lips to his in a pure thrill of sisterly affection and grief;
his glance lifts to hers an instant and remains fixed; a quivering
sigh, a scarcely perceptible shudder, and Willard Clendenon's
spirit has flown out of the earthly heaven of her arms to the
higher heaven of his soul.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Later, as Grace lay weeping in her own room, the bereaved
mother came gliding in. The soft flame of a wax candle lent a
faint, pure light to the room, and showed her gentle face, free
from tears, but seamed with a touching resignation beautiful in
the extreme. What a mournful pathos lies in the grief of an old
face! It is more eloquent than tears, even as silence can be more
eloquent than speech.</p>

<p>Sitting on the edge of Grace's lounge, gently smoothing the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
disheveled curls with her cool fingers, it would seem as if the
younger woman were the mourner, she the comforter.</p>

<p>"God knows best," she says, with a Christian's strong reliance;
and then she added, pathetically: "And it has come to
me suddenly, Gracie, child, that my poor boy was not, perhaps,
quite happy, or, at least, that some grief, at which we never
guessed, was mingled with the quiet thread of his life."</p>

<p>A sudden memory of words of his came into Grace's mind.</p>

<p>"God, when He puts a life-long sorrow on our hearts, usually
compensates for it by giving us a brief span of life in which to
endure it."</p>

<p>"He deserved to be happy," she answered, warmly. "He
was so good, so true. If any merited perfect content, it was
your son."</p>

<p>"You have seen him sometimes in the whirl of gay society,
Grace; did you ever notice in him any peculiar attachment for a
woman?"</p>

<p>"Never," Grace answered, wondering. "He was courteously
polite, deferentially chivalrous to all, but seemed attached to
none in particular. Why do you ask?"</p>

<p>"Because I found this&mdash;I would show it to none but you,
Grace&mdash;on his poor dead heart. It tells its own sad story."</p>

<p>She put into the young girl's hand a broad, flat gold locket,
swinging by a slight gold chain. Almost as if she touched a
coffin-lid, Grace moved the spring.</p>

<p>It flew open. No woman's pictured face smiled back at her&mdash;the
upper lid had a deeply cut inscription, <i>February</i>, 1871&mdash;in
the other deeper side lay a dead white rose, its short, thorny
stem wound about with a tangle of pale-gold hair.</p>

<p>That was all. A sudden memory stirred at Grace's heart, and
it all came back to her. The winter morning in her conservatory
at Norfolk&mdash;the white rose on her breast, the tangled,
broken curl, the gentle good-by. Warm flushes of irrepressible
color surged up to her pale face, and with a sudden shocked
horror Mrs. Clendenon glanced from the stem of the withered
rose to the soft curls she was mechanically smoothing.</p>

<p>It was enough. "My poor boy!" she murmured and
taking Grace Winans in her tender, forgiving, motherly arms,
kissed her forehead.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span></p>

<p>And the tie between the two women never grew less close and
warm. The still form they carried home to Norfolk to lay in its
grave was a mutual sorrowful tie between them forever.</p>

<p>Stella De Vere came next day, heavily vailed, on her father's
arm, and kissed Captain Clendenon in his coffin, leaving a bouquet
of lilies on his pulseless breast.</p>

<p>But at early morning's dawn a slender, white-robed form bent
over him, all her golden tresses sweeping over the heart that
lay under its treasured keepsake still, and a sister's pained and
tender kiss rested warmly on the sealed lips whose untold secret
had come so strangely into her keeping.</p>

<p>The telegraphic message that flashed across the ocean to Lulu
Conway with such mournful tidings never reached her; she was
already on the ocean, homeward bound, having just received
the letter that told of Willard's illness at Memphis. It was not
until she reached home in May, and was safely domiciled at
Ocean View, that Bruce went into Norfolk and brought back
the sad-faced mother, whose mourning weeds were the first
indication to Lulu of her bitter bereavement.</p>

<p>Mrs. Winans, too, was domiciled safely at home again, to the
great delight of honest Norah, who had been left in entire charge
of the stately Winans' mansion, and had fretted herself almost
to a shadow in anticipation of losing her mistress by that "fatal
yellow fever." Even now Norah was hardly morally convinced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
that this were really she. But as the days went by and the
young lady's cheek began to gather color and roundness again,
and her soft, unwonted laugh to wake the sweeping echoes of
the large, silent house, Norah's doubts were displaced by joyful
certainty, and she began to hope that a happier life for the
young lady was presaged by her returning smile and lighter
spirits.</p>

<p>Norah did not know that the hope springing softly in the
wife's heart had such sure foundation to build upon. Grace
had withheld from her the fact that General Winans was coming
home in May, and Norah's secret thoughts and misgivings on
this subject were many.</p>

<p>Poor Norah had never forgiven herself for the loss of the little
child that had been left in its father's care to be so strangely spirited
away. She reproached herself always, in her sensitive soul
feeling herself entirely to blame, and humbly wondering sometimes
how Mrs. Winans could abide the sight of her, much less
her daily personal attendance; while Mrs. Winans herself,
always just, gentle, and considerate to her domestics as to others,
never blamed her in the least, really was fond of the honest
creature, and in her sensitive dread of new faces around, would
not have consented to be deprived of Norah. Indeed, her whole
domestic staff had entered her service when she came as a bride
to Senator Winans' new and beautiful home, and were likely to
remain as long as they behaved passably well. She never drew
a tight rein on the poor creatures, following as nearly as she
could, in her daily life, the golden rule.</p>

<p>A charmingly affectionate billet from Mrs. Conway, the morning
succeeding their return to Ocean View, invited Grace to
come out and see them, as they were all in the deepest grief for the
poor, dear captain&mdash;Lulu, indeed, being excessively shocked
and ill, with the physician in close attendance.</p>

<p>The afternoon found Gracie springing from her phaeton at
the gates of Ocean View, where John, as of old, met her with
an adoring smile on his dark visage.</p>

<p>"And what is the news with you, John?" she asked, good-naturedly,
as she saw that some unusual news agitated his shallow
brain. "What have you been doing all this time with
yourself?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span></p>

<p>"Only jist gittin' married, Miss Grace," he responded, with a
glittering smile, "to jist the prettiest yaller gal ole mis' eber
owned! You 'members of Julie, de chambermaid?"</p>

<p>Grace supplemented her uncontrollable smile with a solid
congratulation in the shape of a bridal gift from her well-filled
porte-monnaie, and swept on to the house.</p>

<p>Mrs. Conway and her nephew met her in the hall, both unaffectedly
glad to see her, and in the midst of much whispering,
they left Bruce below, and went up to Lulu's chamber.</p>

<p>It was so dark in here that Grace, coming directly in from the
May sunshine, at first saw nothing; then, as the gloom cleared
away a little, she distinguished Mrs. Clendenon's black-robed
form sitting near the bed where Lulu lay, white, and still, and
grief-stricken, under the white draperies, with a tiny mite of a
girl-baby (prematurely hurried into the world by grief that
oftenest hurries people out of it) on her arm.</p>

<p>She stooped and kissed the quivering lips that tried to speak,
but could not; and, indeed, what could either say that breathed
aught of comfort to that shocked and distressed young spirit
whose life hung vibrant on a quivering thread? Silence was
perhaps the best comforter then, and Grace took the little newcomer
in her arms, and gently diverted the young mother's
thoughts by tracing vague resemblances to its handsome parents
in the pink and infinitesimal morsel of life&mdash;and what a power
there is in a simple baby-life sometimes!</p>

<p>Lulu's pain was softened momentarily by this idle feminine
chatter and small talk so vigorously maintained, and her tears
remained awhile unwept in their fountains, while now and then a
low whisper to her old friend showed how welcome and appreciated
was that visit.</p>

<p>"If baby lives," she murmured in an undertone to Grace,
"we mean to call it <i>Grace Willard</i>, for you&mdash;and&mdash;brother,"
with a falter over the name. "I think he would have liked it
so."</p>

<p>And Mrs. Winans has hard work to keep back her own tears at
the memories that flow while she holds Lulu's mite of a girl in
her arms&mdash;thronging memories of her own early days of motherhood&mdash;her
nestling baby-boy, her darling so rudely torn from
her breast. She is glad when the afternoon wanes and it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
time to go for she cannot bear to sit there smiling and outwardly
content with that heavy, aching heart.</p>

<p>"Gracie"&mdash;Lulu draws her down to whisper with pink lips
against her ear&mdash;"you may expect him&mdash;General Winans&mdash;at
any hour. He gets into Norfolk to-day. We traveled from
Europe together, but he had to stop in Washington on business,
and gets here this evening, I think. Will you be glad, dear?"</p>

<p>She cannot answer. Her heart is in a great whirl of painful
feelings. Her baby! She wants <i>her</i> baby! The unhealed
wound in the mother-heart will not be satisfied thus. Lulu's
motherhood has thrilled that aching chord afresh; the years
that have passed are but a dream, and she longs to hold her
rosy, laughing boy again to her tortured breast. Mother-love
never grows cold nor dead, mother-grief never can be healed
nor even seared. It "lives eternal" in the mother's breast, the
most exquisite joy, the most exquisite searching pain the human
heart can know.</p>

<p>"You are going to be so happy," Lulu whispers again in her
loving tone, "and, Gracie," with a fluttering sigh. "I have
been so happy in anticipating your happiness!"</p>

<p>Touched to the depths of her warm heart Grace bends to
leave a tender kiss on the pale brow, and promising to come
again, goes out. Her adieus are hastily made to the rest, and
once more in the little pony phaeton she skims over the miles
between her and home. The bright roses that blossom on her
cheeks are sources of undisguised admiration to Norah, who
opines that Mrs. Winans ought to drive every evening.</p>

<p>"Never mind about that, Norah," she answers, indifferently;
"only please brush my curls over fresh, and give me a pretty
white muslin dress to wear this evening."</p>

<p>And Norah obeys in secret wonder at her mistress' suddenly-developed
vanity.</p>

<p>She is lovely enough to be vain when Norah turns her off her
hands as "finished." All that golden glory of ringlets ripples
away from the fair, pure brow enchantingly, sweeping to her
dainty waist in a sweet girlish fashion. A faint flush covers her
cheeks, two stars burn in the violet depths of her eyes, her lips
are unwontedly tender and sweet. The slim, perfect figure is
draped in the misty folds of a snowy muslin, whose loose sleeves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
falling open, leave bare her dimpled white arms and hands.
The low frill of misty lace leaves the white curve of her throat
exposed, with no other ornament than a tea-rose budding
against its lovely whiteness. So as lovely as one can fancy Eve,
fresh from the hands of her Creator, the beautiful, unhappy,
wronged young wife passed from her dressing-room and into
that lovely shrine of her garnered griefs that saw what the world
saw not&mdash;the desolation of that sensitive heart&mdash;the nursery of
her loved, lost baby!</p>

<p>She pushes back the sliding-doors between her own room and
this one, letting the soft, clear light flood its dim recesses, opens
the windows admitting the balmy sea breeze and the moonlight.
Divided then between suspense and pain she throws upward the
lace canopy and stands leaning once more over the empty crib
that seems to her now more like a grave.</p>

<p>"It was May, 1870, when we quarreled here over baby's crib,"
she muses to herself, "and it seems as if years, and years, and
years have gone over my head&mdash;yet this is only May, 1874. Ah!
me."</p>

<p>Did minutes or hours go by? She never knew as she steadied
her soul against the rushing, headlong waves of memory that
threatened to engulf her in its chilling tide. She had put the
past away from her in the excitement of other pursuits and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
other aims, and now&mdash;now it came back, relentless, remorseless,
sweeping her quivering heart-strings, atuning all her sensitive
nerves to pain.</p>

<p><i>Would</i> he come? Her helpless heart throbbed a passive denial.
<i>If</i> he came, as Lulu had asked her, <i>would</i> she be glad?</p>

<p>She scarcely knew. She loved him&mdash;loved him with a pure,
deep love that having once given its pledge to last till death, no
earthly power could alter. Hers was a very strong and faithful
devotion, but human resentment must hold a small place in
the human breast as long as life lasts. And Grace Winans,
brave, patient, tried by fire as she had been, was still only
mortal. If he came, strengthened, purified, enobled by suffering
and sad experience, they must still meet, she thinks, with a
sharp heart-pang, as over a <i>grave</i>&mdash;the grave of their child; the
winsome baby whom she sees in fancy at his childish play on
the nursery rug, toddling over the floor, laughing in her arms,
catching at her long, bright curls&mdash;what shall she say to the
man whose folly has deprived her of all this joy, when he comes
to ask forgiveness?</p>

<p>"God help me!" she moans, and drops her hopeless head upon
her hands.</p>

<p>"Gracie!"</p>

<p>Does her heart deceive her ears? She glances shyly up, sees
<i>him</i> standing not three feet from her, and he lifts the little child
by his side, and tossing him into the crib, growing too small for
his boyish proportions, says, wistfully:</p>

<p>"Gracie, I have brought him back to you to plead his father's
cause."</p>

<p>One long look into the boyish beauty of that face that has not
outgrown its infantile bloom, and her arms are about the little
form, though silent in her joy as in her grief no word escapes
her lips.</p>

<p>"Mamma, my own lovely mamma!" the little boy lisps, tutored
thereto no doubt by his father's wisdom, and her only answer
is in raining kisses, smiles and tears.</p>

<p>It is so long before she thinks of the silent father that when
she turns it is only to find him kneeling at her feet. On the
dusk beauty of that proud face she sees the sharp traces of suffering,
weariness, almost hopelessness. He takes the small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
hand that falls passive to her side, touching it lightly to his
feverish lips.</p>

<p>"Gracie," she hears in the low, strong accents of despair,
"there is nothing I can say for myself&mdash;I am at your foot to
hear my doom! Whatever you accord me, it cannot be utter
despair, since I am blessed beyond measure in having looked
even once more on your beloved face."</p>

<p>For minutes she looked down on that bowed head in silence.
All the love and pride, all the good and evil in her nature are
warring against each other. Shall she let the cruel past go by,
or shall she&mdash;and then, between her and these tumultuous
thoughts, rises the face of one who is an angel in heaven&mdash;her
lips part to speak, and close mutely; she smiles, then slowly
falling like the perfuming petals of a great white rose, her white
robes waver to the floor, and her small hand flutters down on
his shoulder, and she is kneeling beside him.</p>

<p>He looks up with an unspoken prayer of thanksgiving on his
mobile features, and twines strong, loving arms about the form
that has fallen unconscious against his breast.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>General Winans takes his wife abroad to escape the "nine
days wonder." Norah goes with them, in charge of little
Earle, her face glowing like a miniature sun with delight at the
way that "things," in her homely phraseology "have turned
out."</p>

<p>They visit the adopted grandparents of little Earle, and are
<i>feted</i> and flattered by them, until sweet Grace in the fullness of
her own happiness and her compassion for them, promises them
an annual visit. <i>Deo volent</i>, from the small idol of her heart
and theirs.</p>

<p>And, "by the way," in Paris&mdash;"dear, delightful Paris"&mdash;where
they sojourn awhile, they meet&mdash;who else but Major
Frank Fontenay, U. S. A., "doing the honeymoon" in most
approved style with the "fair Cordelia, the banker's heiress."
And thus has the susceptible major consoled himself for Lulu's
rejection. It is needless to say that these two couples uniting,
"do" the tour of Europe in the most leisurely and pleasant manner,
and are duly favored with honors and attentions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span></p>

<p>Latest advises from Norfolk report the Winans and Conway
families as on the happiest terms. Rumor says, indeed, that the
two young mothers have prospectively betrothed the fragile
little brown-eyed Grace Willard to the handsome young Earle
Willoughby, the hopeful heir of two fortunes. "However these
things be," we leave them to the future, which takes care of
itself.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>And far down a shady path in one of Norfolk's lovely cemeteries
there rises a low green grave, over which a costly white
marble shaft, never without its daily wreath of fresh white roses
through all of summer's golden days, tapers sadly against the
blue sky, telling all who care to know that</p>

"Gismonda" will prove a favorite with the novel-reading public and become

<p><i>Philadelphia Item</i>: The kind of book which one sits over till he has
finished the last word. It is a clever piece of literary work.</p>

that it is of intense interest.</p>

<p><i>Buffalo News</i>: A vivid and powerful story.</p>

<p><i>Brooklyn Eagle</i>: The amplification into the novel is done by Mr. A. D.
Hall, who presents a full and interesting picture of modern or rather medieval
Greece. The plot is quite original.</p>

<p class="center medium"><i>OPINIONS OF THE PRESS</i>:</p>

<p><i>Brooklyn Standard-Union</i>: A most captivating story.</p>

<p><i>Buffalo Times</i>: The story is full of dramatic situations.</p>

<p><i>Pittsburgh Leader</i>: It is a romance well worth reading.</p>

<p><i>Philadelphia Call</i>: An interesting and graphic story good for seashore, hammock

<p><i>The New York World</i>: A very charming novel of the romantic school, full of love
and adventure.</p>

<p><i>Albany Times</i>: "A Gentleman from Gascony," by Bicknell Dudley, is an exciting
and well-told story.</p>

<p><i>The Brooklyn Citizen</i>: The story is full of fine dramatic situations, and is never
lacking in action. The author has the knack of holding the reader's attention
throughout the entire story.</p>

<p><i>San Francisco Chronicle</i>: "A Gentleman from Gascony," by Bicknell Dudley,
while it at once recalls our dear old friends of the "Three Musketeers," is a bright,
clever, well-written and entertaining story. The book gives a graphic and vivid
picture of one of the great historic epochs of France.</p>

<p><i>Rochester Herald</i>: It is a positive relief to turn from the morbid fancies of the
Madame Grands and the Grant Allens to such a purely romantic love tale as "A
Gentleman from Gascony," by Bicknell Dudley, which Street &amp; Smith publish in
yellow covers, while deserving of more substantial garb. The story is a formidable
rival of Mr. Stanley Weyman's premier effort.</p>

<p><i>Louisville Courier-Journal</i>: It is a thoroughly readable novel that Bicknell Dudley
has contributed to current literature under the title of "A Gentleman from Gascony."
Although the title recalls Stanley Weyman's "Gentleman of France" and
the scenes of both stories are laid in the time of Henri of Navarre, they are not alike,
save in the fact that both the "Gentleman of France," and the "Gentleman from Gascony"
are heroes in the fullest sense of the term from a romantic standpoint.</p>

<p><i>Pittsburgh Press</i>: Bicknell Dudley has written another story, based on French history,
around the time of the St. Bartholomew massacre. It is a tale of adventure
with a single hero, who embodies in himself the wile of an Aramis, the strength of a
Porthos, and the gallantry of a D'Artagnan. The adventures of the Chevalier de
Puycadere are, even if impossible in these days, still redolent of the times of knight
errantry, when every good sword won its way and was faithful. Although he was
an illustrious chevalier both in love and war, he was certainly no chevalier d'industrie,
and happily comes out triumphant.</p>

<p><i>The Argus</i>, Albany, N. Y.: The hero is a young Gascon full of dash and courage,
of good blood but impoverished estates, who comes to Paris to seek his fortune. This
he accomplishes after many adventures, sometimes by bravado, sometimes by bravery.
There is a strong love story between Gabrielle de Vrissac, a maid of honor to
the Queen of Navarre, and the Gascon, Raoul de Puycadere. Many historical characters
figure among them&mdash;Henri of Navarre, Marguerite de Valois, Catherine de
Medicis, and Charles IX., and Admiral Coliquy. The author, Bicknell Dudley, exhibits
literary ability of the very first order.</p>

<p><i>Baltimore American</i>: "A Gentleman from Gascony," by Bicknell Dudley. This
is a tale of the time of Charles IX., the story opening in the year 1572. Raoul de Puycadere
is of a noble family, but his possessions have been squandered by his ancestors,
and he leaves for Paris to better his position at court. He arrives on the eve of
the massacre of St. Bartholomew, and his lady love, Gabrielle, having heard of the
contemplated killing, binds a sign on his arm to protect him. By great good luck he
is made equerry to the King of Navarre, and between his duties as equerry and his
lovemaking passes through many exciting adventures.</p>

<p>"'Richard Forrest, Bachelor,' by Clement R. Marley, is a bright and
pleasing story. The love story of the old bachelor, whose heart was so

bachelor."&mdash;<i>New York Press.</i></p>

Bachelor,' and it is very entertaining."&mdash;<i>Brooklyn Eagle.</i></p>

There are strong religious sentiments, and the author puts forth some well-defined
ideas on the social relations of men and women."&mdash;<i>Philadelphia
Call.</i></p>

<p>"A novel of more than usual interest is 'Richard Forrest, Bachelor.'
It describes scenes and incidents that may be seen and experienced by any
one in similar circumstances. There is much that is strange and stirring in
the story, yet nature is not departed from either in the incidents or characters
introduced."&mdash;<i>Brooklyn Citizen.</i></p>

<p>"A well-told tale of sustained interest and dramatic character."&mdash;<i>Sacramento
Record-Union.</i></p>

<p>"The author tells the story of an old bachelor's love. He gets well
along in life invulnerable to Cupid's dart, and then he detects the woman
of his heart's choice in an attempt upon the life of his bosom friend, to
avenge an imaginary wrong. It is very true to life."&mdash;<i>Atlanta Journal.</i></p>

<p>"'Richard Forrest, Bachelor,' is after the style of 'Mr. Barnes of New
York,' but is rather better written."&mdash;<i>Hartford Times.</i></p>

so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

<p>To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project

<h3>Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works</h3>

<p>1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.</p>

<p>1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.</p>

<p>1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p>1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.</p>

<p>1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:</p>

<p>1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:</p>

<blockquote><p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United
  States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost
  no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use
  it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with
  this eBook or online
  at <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
  are not located in the United States, you'll have to check the laws
  of the country where you are located before using this
  ebook.</p></blockquote>

<p>1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.</p>

<p>1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.</p>

<p>1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.</p>

<p>1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>

<p>1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that</p>

<ul>
<li>You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."</li>

<li>You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.</li>

<li>You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.</li>

<li>You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>
</ul>

<p>1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.</p>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<p>1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.</p>

<p>1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.</p>

<p>1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

<p>1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.</p>

<p>1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.  </p>

<h3>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3>Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

<h3>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
